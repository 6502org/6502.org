<p></p><h3>Linear Congruential Pseudo-Random Number Generator Routines</h3>
by Bruce Clark, 7 Jun 2004
<hr>

<P>Random numbers are a complex and highly debated subject.  The routines
presented here use a method known as the linear congruential method.  While
no method of generating random numbers is perfect, the linear congruential
method is widely considered to be a reasonable method.  Only the basics of
this method will be covered.  For further information, the book "The Art Of
Computer Programming, Volume 2" by Donald Knuth is highly recommended.  Half
of the book (chapter 3) covers the topic of random numbers.  The strengths
and weakness of the common random number generators are discussed, and
numerous empirical and theoretical tests for randomness are described.  In
addition, it suggests several guidelines for random number generators.  The
book is quite mathematically intense, but it covers random numbers
thoroughly.

<P>A pseudo-random number generator does not return an unpredictable number, like
rolling a die would.  The idea is to take a long sequence of numbers and
return them, one by one, in an order that seems random.  The key is to start
at a random point in this sequence.  This starting point is called the seed.
The idea is to make sequence long enough so that only a fraction of the
sequence will be used when generating random numbers.  Then, by starting a
random place is the sequence, the fraction of the sequence used will be
unlikely to overlap from one run to the next.

<P>Note that by starting with the same seed, the same sequence of numbers can
be generated repeatedly.  This can be a useful feature.

<P>On the 6502, 8-bit or 16-bit random numbers will be the most common, so the
generator will return a 32-bit number.  Each of the 2^32 possible values will
be returned by the generator, in a seemingly random order, of course.

<P>The term "linear congruential" sounds scary, but there are only two steps
involved: multplication and addition.  To get the new seed (i.e. the next
number in the sequence), the old seed is multiplied by a constant, a, called
the multiplier, then a second constant, c, is added to the product.  The new
seed is the lower 32 bits (remember, this generator returns 32-bit numbers)
of the result.  (Actually, keeping only the lower 32 bits is really a third
step, and in fact, it is an extremely important step.)  The computation
performed is:

<p><code>seed = a * seed + c</code></p>

<P>It turns out that the real key to making a linear congruential generator work
is selecting a good value for a, the multiplier.  The constant, c, is not as
critical as the multiplier, but it must be an odd number.  In fact, c can be
chosen to be one, and this is what the routines here use, since it will
simplify the calculation.

<P>Note that an odd number (the old seed) times an odd number (the multiplier,
a) is an odd number, and an odd number (the product) plus an odd number (the
constant, c) will be an even number.  Likewise, an even number times an odd
number, plus an odd number will be an odd number.  So the seed will alternate
between odd and even numbers.  This means that the upper bits of the seed
must be used for generating 8-bit and 16-bit random numbers.

<P>The first subroutine is called <code>RAND</code> and it performs the <code>seed = a * seed + 1</code>
(remember, c = 1 was chosen) calculation.  There are three versions, a fast
version, a short (in terms of number of bytes) version, and a middle version,
which is between the other two versions in terms of space and speed, yet is
reasonably short and reasonably fast.

<P>The multiplier 1664525 (in hex, $19660D) is used in all three versions.  This
multiplier was chosen from line 16 of the table on p. 106 of "The Art Of
Computer Programming, Volume 2".  (That table lists various multipliers and
their result in the spectral test, a critical theoretical test for measuring
randomness.)

<P>The seed is stored in <code>SEED3</code> (high byte) through <code>SEED0</code> (low byte).  Putting
<code>SEED3</code> through <code>SEED0</code> on the zero page will be faster and shorter (i.e. fewer
bytes), but it is not necessary.

<P>The fast version works by using four pages of pre-computed tables.  There are
four 256-byte tables, which are named T3, T2, T1, T0.

<p><code>
T3,X = byte X of T3 = bits 31-24 of 1664525 * X, (X = 0 to 255)<br />
T2,X = byte X of T2 = bits 23-16 of 1664525 * X, (X = 0 to 255)<br />
T1,X = byte X of T1 = bits 15-8 &nbsp;of 1664525 * X, (X = 0 to 255)<br />
T0,X = byte X of T0 = bits 7-0 &nbsp;&nbsp;of 1664525 * X, (X = 0 to 255)<br />
</code></p>

<P>The product of 1664525 * SEED is:

<p><img src="random_1.gif" border="0" align="center"></p>

<p>Since only the lowest 4 bytes are kept, the multiplication is: (for brevity,
SEED3 to SEED0 are called S3 to S0)</p>

<p>In the <code>RAND</code> routine, the <code>ADC #1</code> instruction can be eliminated by calculating
1664525 * X + 1 and storing the result in tables <code>T3I</code> through <code>T0I</code>.  <code>SEED0</code> will
then use <code>T<i>n</i>I</code> (n = 0 to 3) and <code>SEED1</code> through <code>SEED3</code> will use <code>T<i>n</i></code>.  Since table
<code>T3</code> was only used by <code>SEED0</code>, it (<code>T3</code>) will no longer be necessary.  Table <code>T2</code>
will be identical to <code>T2I</code>, so table <code>T2</code> can also be eliminated.  This means
only 6 pages of tables (<code>T0, T1, T0I, T1I, T2I, </code>and <code>T3I</code>) are needed and that
<code>JSR RAND</code> will take 92 cycles.</p>

<P>The short version is just an ordinary 32-bit * 32-bit multiplication routine.
The <code>DB</code> pseudo-op is called <code>.BYTE</code> on some assemblers.  Consult the assembler
documentation for the pseudo-op name it expects.</p>

<p>Since the carry is known to be set after the <code>BCC RAND4</code>, the <code>CLC</code> can be
eliminated by adding <code>$0019660C</code> instead of <code>$0019660D</code>, saving one byte.</p>

<P>The routine will take one fewer byte if <code>RAND6</code> (the multiplier) is located on
the zero page.  However, since the zero page is usually RAM, <code>RAND6</code> would have
to be initialized somehow, which would likely nullify the one byte savings.

<P>The middle version is similar to the typical 6502 non-looping multiply-by-10
routines, which are tailored to multiply by a specific number.
Unfortunately, this routine must be rewritten if a different multiplier is to
be used.  The idea to add seed, $100 * seed, $10000 * seed, and/or
$1000000 * seed when necessary (as determined by the multiplier), then shift
seed (left), and repeat.  Specifically,

<P><code>Bit 0 of $0D (multiplier byte 0) is 1<BR/>
Bit 0 of $66 (multiplier byte 1) is 0<BR/>
Bit 0 of $19 (multiplier byte 2) is 1<BR/>
Bit 0 of $00 (multiplier byte 3) is 0<BR/>
</code></p>

<P>so, seed is added to $10000 * seed, and seed is shifted left (multiplied by
2)</p>

<P><code>Bit 1 of $0D is 0<BR/>
Bit 1 of $66 is 1<BR/>
Bit 1 of $19 is 0<BR/>
Bit 1 of $00 is 0<BR/>
</code></p>

<P>so, $100 * seed is added to the previous result, and seed is shifted left</p>

<P><code>Bit 2 of $0D is 1<BR/>
Bit 2 of $66 is 1<BR/>
Bit 2 of $19 is 0<BR/>
Bit 2 of $00 is 0<BR/>
</code></p>

<P>so $100 * seed + seed is added to the previous result, and so on.</p>

<p>Having selected a <code>RAND</code> routine, the next step is to turn the new seed into a
(pseudo-)random number.  For a random number between 0 and 255 ($FF)
inclusive, simply use <code>SEED3</code>.  For a random number between 0 and 65535
($FFFF), use <code>SEED2</code> for the low byte and <code>SEED3</code> for the high byte.  For a
random number between 0 and 1, use bit 7 of <code>SEED3</code>. For a random number
between 0 and 3, use bits 7 through 6 of <code>SEED3</code>.  For a random number between
0 and 7, use bits 7 through 5 of <code>SEED3</code>, and so on.  Any random number between
0 and one less than a power of 2 is easily obtained, but what about a random
number between 0 and 5, say?  The solution is to multiply <code>SEED</code> by 6 (5 plus
one) and keep the upper 8 bits of the 40-bit product.  In this case, 6 is
known as the modulus.</p>

<P>The result is the <code>RANDOM</code> subroutine, which returns a random number, <code>RND</code>,
where <code>0 <= RND < MOD</code>, and <code>MOD</code> is the modulus.  There are two versions of
<code>RANDOM</code>, one for 8-bit <code>RND</code> and <code>MOD</code>, and one for 16-bit <code>RND</code> and <code>MOD</code>.  The 8-bit
version, called <code>RANDOM8</code>, is up first, and it uses the number in the
accumulator as the modulus, and returns the random number in the accumulator.</p>

<p>There are 2^32 possible values for SEED.  When using a modulus that is a
power of 2, each possible value (of <code>RND</code>) returned by <code>RANDOM</code> is equally
likely.  However, when modulus of 6 is used, for example, some of the
possible values are a teensy (a very, very teensy) bit more likely than
others, since 2^32 is not a multiple of 6.  But 2^32 - 4 is a multiple of 6,
so one solution is to reject four possible values of seed by simply calling
<code>RAND</code> again to get the next seed when one of those four possibilities is
encountered.  Since only four values out of 2^32 get rejected, it is highly
unlikely that two consecutive seed values will be rejected, so at most, <code>RAND</code>
will be called twice.  The right sequence can ensure that this is so.  The
question is, which four values should be rejected?</p>

<P>To answer this question, a simpler example is in order, specifically a 4-bit
seed, and a modulus of 7.  Since 16-2 is multiple of 7, two values must be
rejected.  Since there are only 16 possible seed values, all 16 possibilites
will be listed, along with the corresponding seed * modulus product.</p>

<p>The random numbers (the upper 3 bits of seed * modulus) 0 and 3 occur three
times, and the rest occur twice.  Notice the lower 4 bits of seed * modulus.
When the lower 4 bits are less than 2 (the number of seed values to reject),
the upper 3 bits are 000 or 011.  Also, when the lower 4 bits are greater
than or equal to 16-2, the upper three bits are 000 or 011.  This means than
there are two ways to determine whether to get the next seed (a) if the lower
bits of seed * modulus are less than the number of seed values to reject, or
(b) if the lower bits are greater than or equal to 16 minus the number of
seed values to reject.</p>

<P>The latter method will be used because it can be implemented little faster.
For the 32-bit case, this means checking when the lower 32 bits of the
seed * modulus product is less than 2^32 minus the number of seed values to
reject.  This will be checked by adding the number of seed values to reject
to the lower 32 bits of the product and looking for a carry from the 32-bit
addition.</p>

<P>The only remaining question is, how many seed values should be rejected?
This can be calculated by dividing 2^32 by the modulus.  The remainder from
this division is the number of seed values to reject.</p>

<P>The subroutine that does all of this is called <code>URANDOM</code>, because it returns a
random number with a uniform distribution.  Like <code>RANDOM</code>, it returns a random
number, <code>RND</code>, where <code>0 <= RND < MOD</code>.  There are also two versions, one for
8-bit <code>RND</code> and <code>MOD</code>, and one for 16-bit <code>RND</code> and <code>MOD</code>.  The 8-bit version, called
<code>URANDOM8</code>, is once again up first, and it uses the number in the accumulator
as the modulus, and returns the random number in the accumulator.

<p>URANDOM16 could be sped up slightly by replacing the SEC instruction with a
LDA #1 instruction followed by a branch (BNE) to the first TAY instruction.
Then, the ROL at UR16A can be changed to an ASL, and the CLC just before
UR16C can be deleted.</p>

<P>Finally, here is a routine that allows the RAND routine to be accessed via
the USR function in EhBASIC.  Rbyte4 through RByte1 (the seed for the RND
function) could be used for SEED3 through SEED0 as follows:</p>

<P><code>SEED0 = Rbyte4<BR />
SEED3 = SEED0+1<BR />
SEED2 = SEED0+2<BR />
SEED1 = SEED0+3<BR />
</code></p>

<P>Note that <code>Rbyte4</code> through <code>Rbyte1</code> are not in order in memory!  The downside to
using <code>Rbyte</code> is if <code>RND</code> and <code>USR</code> are both used.  The <code>RND</code> seed (<code>Rbyte</code>) cannot be
all zeros, or <code>RND</code> will always return 0, but an all zero seed is perfectly
fine for a linear congruential generator.  (EhBASIC cleverly avoids an all
zeros seed by setting the seed only on a non-zero argument to <code>RND</code>.)  <code>SEED3</code>
through <code>SEED0</code> could use unused zero page locations (such as <code>$DE</code> to <code>$E1</code>) or
other unused RAM elsewhere instead.

<P><code>FAC1_1</code> is used for <code>TMP</code>, since it and the next 3 locations (<code>FAC1_2, FAC1_3,</code>
and <code>FAC1_s</code>) are overwritten after the <code>JSR RAND</code> anyway.  <code>FAC1_e</code> could also
be used since the next 3 locations are <code>FAC1_1, FAC1_2,</code> and <code>FAC1_3</code>.

<P>Since the usage of <code>USR</code> is identical to that of <code>RND</code>, <code>RND</code> can simply be
replaced by <code>USR</code>.  Remember, before using <code>USR</code>, the statement <code>DOKE 11,<i>address</i></code>
(where address is the address of the routine below) must be used to set
the <code>USR</code> vector.
