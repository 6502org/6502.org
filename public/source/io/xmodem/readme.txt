Hi!

Here are my XMODEM/CRC file transfer routines.  I've included three
files for your use.

"xmodem-send.txt" contains the routines to send a file from your
65c02 system to a terminal program on another computer.  Use this file if you
plan to only send data from your 65C02 to another Computer.

"xmodem-receive.txt" contains the routines to send a file from another
computer to your 65C02 system.  Use this file if you plan to only send
data from another Computer to your 65C02 system.

"xmodem.txt" contains both routines, combining several common routines to
save space.  Use this file if you plan to send and receive data.

All three files are well documented and were tested using 
Windows 98's HyperTerminal.
