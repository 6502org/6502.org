<P>
Here are my XMODEM/CRC file transfer routines for 6502-based
computers with a 6551 serial port.  I've included three files for your
use.
<P>
<A HREF="xmodem-send.txt">xmodem-send.txt</A> - contains the routines to
send a file from your
65c02 system to a terminal program on another computer.  Use this file if
you
plan to only send data from your 65C02 to another Computer.
<P>
<A HREF="xmodem-receive.txt">xmodem-receive.txt</A> - contains the
routines to send a file from another computer to your 65C02 system.  Use
this file if you plan to only send data from another Computer to your
65C02 system.
<P>
<A HREF="xmodem.txt">xmodem.txt</A> - contains both routines, combining
several common routines to save space.  Use this file if you plan to send
and receive data.
<P>
All three files are well documented and were tested using
Windows 98's HyperTerminal.
