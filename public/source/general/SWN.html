<P>David Galloway made this suggestion on the facebook 6502 Programming group, for
swapping nybbles.  $36 becomes $63, $A1 becomes $1A, etc..  It takes only 8 bytes
and 12 clock cycles, and no variables, no stack usage, no look-up table, no X or Y
usage.  It uses only the accumulator and status register.

<PRE>
        ASL  A
        ADC  #$80
        ROL  A
        ASL  A
        ADC  #$80
        ROL  A

</PRE>
Straight-lining it takes only five bytes more than a subroutine call and cuts the execution time in half.  It could of course be put in a macro.  How that is done exactly will depend on your assembler, but might go something like:
<PRE>

SWN:    MACRO
        ASL  A
        ADC  #$80
        ROL  A
        ASL  A
        ADC  #$80
        ROL  A
        ENDM

</PRE>
and would be called simply with<font face="courier"> SWN </font> as if it were an assembly-language mnemonic.  You probably won't use it many times in a program anyway for the straight-lining to take up appreciable memory, but you might want it pretty fast when you do.
