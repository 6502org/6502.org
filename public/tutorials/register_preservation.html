<p></p><h3>Register Preservation Using The Stack (and a BRK handler)</h3>
by Bruce Clark, 7 Jun 2004
<hr>

<p>On the 65C02, a subroutine can save the A, X, and Y registers without altering them by using:</p>

<pre>
PHA
PHX
PHY
</pre>

<p>The subroutine then restores A, X, and Y by exiting with:</p>

<pre>
PLY
PLX
PLA
RTS
</pre>

<p>The PHX/PLX and PHY/PLY instructions are not available on the 6502.  On the 6502, A, X, and Y are often saved using:</p>

<pre>
PHA
TXA
PHA
TYA
PHA
</pre>

<p>which preserves X and Y, but overwrites A.  The subroutine then restores A,
X, and Y by exiting with:</p>

<pre>
PLA
TAY
PLA
TAX
PLA
RTS
</pre>

<p>One way to preserve A (to allow it to be passed as a parameter to the
subroutine) -- as well as X and Y -- is to use:</p>

<pre>
STA TEMP
PHA
TXA
PHA
TYA
PHA
LDA TEMP
</pre>

<p>which takes 4 additional bytes and 6 additional cycles if TEMP is a zero page
location, and 6 additional bytes and 8 additional cycles if TEMP is an
absolute memory location.</p>

<p>This is usually sufficient, but if, for example, the subroutine is used by the
main program and by an interrupt routine, interrupts must be disabled so that
TEMP will not be in use when the interrupt occurs.</p>

<p>An alternative is to use:</p>

<pre>
PHA
TXA
TSX
PHA
TYA
PHA
INX
LDA $100,X ; get A from the stack
</pre>

<p>which takes 5 additional bytes and 8 additional cycles (as compared to the
the first 6502 example, not the previous example) but interrupts need not
be disabled since it gets A from the stack rather than requiring a special
memory location.  This could be used in a subroutine called by an NMI (since
an NMI can't be disabled).  Remember, NMIs are dangerous, and should be used
with extreme caution if at all.</p>

<p>Notice that the idea is to get the stack pointer into X as soon as possible
so that the number INX instructions needed can be minimized.</p>

<p>The code above works correctly regardless of the value of the stack pointer.
As long as the stack pointer is not $FF, the last two instructions could be
replaced with a LDA $101,X instruction, which would save 1 byte and two
cycles.  Ordinarily, this is not a problem since the stack pointer is usually
initialized to $FF (and will therefore be less than $FF after the PHA).  It
goes without saying that the software should be fully debugged before even
considering the LDA $101,X change.</p>

<p>The code above preserves A, but overwrites X.  To preserve A, X, and Y, use:</p>

<pre>
PHA
TXA
TSX
PHA
TYA
PHA
INX
LDA $100,X ; get A from the stack
PHA
DEX
LDA $100,X ; get X from the stack
TAX
PLA
</pre>

<p>which is 7 bytes and 15 cycles longer than the previous example.  This may be
more trouble than it is worth, but it could come in handy for subroutines
that are used for debugging (where the idea is to be as independent as
possible and to stay as far out of the way of the main program as possible).</p>

<p>The preceding techniques can also be applied to the BRK/IRQ interrupt
handler.  For example, on the 6502,</p>

<pre>
PHA
TXA
TSX
PHA
INX
INX
LDA $100,X ; get the status register from the stack
AND #$10   ; mask B flag
BNE BREAK
BEQ IRQ
</pre>

<p>can be used to determine whether the interrupt was caused by a BRK
instruction or an IRQ.  Ordinarily, of course, the code would simply fall
through to the IRQ handler, eliminating the BEQ instruction.  The BRK and
IRQ handlers would then exit with:</p>

<pre>
PLA
TAX
PLA
RTI
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, A and X could be restored immediately after branching (or
falling through) to the BRK or IRQ interrupt handler.</p>

<p>On the 65C02, with PHX and PLX available,</p>

<pre>
PHX
TSX
PHA
INX
INX
LDA $100,X ; get the status register from the stack
AND #$10   ; mask B flag
BNE BREAK
BEQ IRQ
</pre>

<p>can be used, which takes 1 fewer byte and 2 fewer cycles than the 6502
example.  The BRK and IRQ handlers would then exit with:</p>

<pre>
PLA
PLX
RTI
</pre>

<p>which also takes 1 fewer byte and 2 fewer cycles than the 6502 example.</p>

<p>Note that A and X are saved in the opposite order that they were in the 6502
example!</p>

<p>The B (Break) flag, bit 4 of the P (Processor status) register, is a frequent
source of confusion on the 6502.  The sole purpose of this flag is to
distinguish a BRK from a IRQ.  However, the behavior of BRK and IRQ (and how
to distinguish between the two) can be described  without even mentioning the
B flag.</p>

<p>After the return address has been pushed onto the stack, a BRK instruction
pushes the value of the P register ORed with $10, then transfers control to
the BRK/IRQ interrupt handler.</p>

<p>After the return address has been pushed onto the stack, an IRQ interrupt
pushes the value of the P register ANDed with $EF, then transfers control to
the BRK/IRQ interrupt handler.</p>

<p>This means that the value of the P register that was pushed onto the stack
must be used to distinguish a BRK from a IRQ, not the value of the P register
upon entry to the BRK/IRQ interrupt handler.  Specifically,</p>

<pre>
PHA
PHP
PLA
AND #$10  ; mask B flag
BNE BREAK
BEQ IRQ
</pre>

<p>does NOT properly distinguish a BRK from an IRQ!</p>

<p><b>Chelly adds:</b> <i>At the end proper checking of the B flag is discussed.
My feedback is that it would be simpler to explain that there is no B flag in
the processor status register; that bit is simply unused. When pushing the
status register on the stack, that bit is set to a fixed value based on the
instruction/event (set for PHP and BRK, clear for NMI). This is much simpler
to explain and leads to no incorrect assumption that there is a B flag in the
status register that can be checked.</i></p>
