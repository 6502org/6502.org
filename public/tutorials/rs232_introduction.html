<H1>Introduction to RS-232</H1>

<P>It may seem rather late to be putting up an RS-232 primer in this day of PCs
that come without RS-232 (COM) ports, but RS-232 still has a lot of
uses from vintage computers to new simple serial connections that can
be completely created, hacked, and controlled by the technician or
hobbyist.</P>

<P>The RS-232 so-called standard has been around for over three decades.
In spite of the confusion it produces, it is still a popular
workhorse.  It may seem like too many things about this
&quot;standard&quot; are not standard at all. Unfortunately,
much of what RS-232 started getting used for immediately (and is
still used for today) is not what it was originally specified for,
which is connecting modems (data communications equipment, or DCE) to
other things like computers, terminals, and printers (data terminal
equipment, or DTE). We will give an RS-232 introduction here,
starting with the most basic elements, which are enough to be useful
for simple data communications. We will leave the
troubleshooting of more complex problems to the reader, referring to
a list of RS-232 books at the end.</P>

<P>In RS-232, data is sent on a wire as a series of positive and negative
voltages, one bit at a time (hence the word &quot;serial&quot;).
Each frame begins with a start bit, which is followed by five to
eight data bits (sent low bit first), followed by an optional parity
bit for error-checking, and ending with one to two stop bits.
Take figure 1 for example:</P>

<center>
<IMG ALT="RS-232 waveform" SRC="/tutorials/rs232/figure_1.gif">
</center>

<P>The first thing that you'll probably think looks wrong here is that the
ones are the low voltage, and the zeroes are high.  It's not
this way at the UART pins, but the line drivers and receivers invert
it.  Logic 1 is also called &quot;mark&quot;.  &quot;UART&quot;
here stands for &quot;universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter&quot;.
Do not confuse this with the line drivers and receivers. The
UART takes care of shifting the bytes in and out, generating the
timing and the various housekeeping bits, detecting errors, and so
on.  The line drivers and receivers are nothing but inverters
that also serve as voltage translators between TTL logic levels and
the &plusmn;10V (give or take a few volts) actually used on RS-232
lines. On a schematic diagram they are represented by the
inverter symbol.</P>

<P>Before the frame can begin, the line has to be marking; ie, sending the
voltage corresponding to &quot;1&quot;. The transition to the
0, also called &quot;space&quot;, for the start bit tells the
receiver when the frame is beginning, essentially starting its
timer. This time reference edge is important because the only
way the receiver knows which bit it should be receiving at any given
time is by how long ago the start bit began. This is why it's
called &quot;asynchronous&quot;. There's no separate clock line
to tell when the next bit is ready to read.&nbsp; The receiver bears
the responsibility of keeping time so it knows which bit it is
receiving. Obviously the transmitter and receiver have to agree
on how long a bit will last. That's where the baud rate comes
in. More on that later.</P>

<P>After the eight data bits shown above, we have the parity bit. In
this case, it's even parity. That means there has to be an even
number of ones between the start bit and the stop bit. If there
are an odd number of ones in the data bits, the parity bit gets set
to make the number of ones even. The purpose is to check for
errors. Obviously if you have two wrong bits (even if one of
them is the parity bit itself), parity error-checking could be
fooled; but it's pretty highly unlikely that you'll have <I>two</I>
wrong bits in the same frame if the data link seems to be working at
all. Use of the parity bit is optional and not very common.
If the data line is producing errors because of severe interference
or any other reason, the UART will be reporting framing errors
anyway.</P>

<P>The receiver looks for a &quot;1&quot; stop bit at the end of the frame.
A framing error is reported when that stop bit doesn't come when the
receiver expects it. The problem could be that the transmitter
and receiver aren't set for the same speed, number of data bits, or
whether or not to use a parity bit, or the cable may be picking up
severe interference or simply be too long for the chosen speed,
resulting in a very wobbly triangle wave instead of a clean set of
high and low voltages resembling square waves. The RS-232
standard suggests that cables should not be more than 50 feet long.
You can go much, much longer if necessary, but it may mean slowing
the baud rate way down to get dependable data transfer.</P>

<P>It's most common to use a single stop bit when using 7 or 8 data bits.
1&frac12; or 2 stop bits are generally used when the frame is very
short from using only 5 or 6 data bits. After the full stop bit
time, the next start bit can begin any time-- assuming the receiver
hasn't told the transmitter that it's not ready for more data yet.
More on that later. If the transmitter is set for more stop
bits than the receiver is, it will not cause any problems. The
receiver will see the extra time marking as nothing more than a
little blank time between frames. But if the receiver is
expecting more stop bits than the transmitter is sending, an error
condition is generated.</P>

<P>The MS-DOS command you might recognize as one that was relatively common
and typical for setting up a com port on a PC, &quot;<code>MODE
COM2: 9600,N,8,1</code>&quot; sets com2 up for 9600 baud, no parity
bit, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit.</P>

<P>As you can see, a two-wire connection consisting of signal and ground is
enough to transfer data in one direction. Since the voltages
are high, and the source and load impedance are rather low, and the
rise and fall times are not very fast for the length and capacitance
of the cable we would probably be using to transfer data across a
workbench, we can enjoy the fact that almost any cheap cable will
do-- even lamp cord. Adding one wire (to get three) is enough
to have data going both directions, even simultaneously. The
only caveat we have if more wires are not used is that the receiver
must always be ready to receive data as fast as the transmitter will
send it (unless a software protocol is used for the two ends to tell
each other when they are or aren't ready for more data. Such
software handshaking will not be discussed here.)</P>

<P>We already mentioned framing errors and parity errors. If the
receiving end cannot process the data as fast as it's coming, a byte
which the processor has not yet read from the UART's receive buffer
could get overwritten by a new byte coming in. Then the UART
would signal an overrun error. These three-- the parity error,
the framing error, and the overrun error-- are the three that the
6551 reports.&nbsp; The 6551 UART is also called an ACIA, for
&quot;asynchronous communications interface adapter&quot;.</P>

<P>We should mention that although UARTs are mentioned throughout this
introduction, it is possible (as you probably already figured out) to
do the UART job in software, doing what we call &quot;bit-banging&quot;
with individual parallel port bits of I/O ICs like the 6522. I
believe the Commodore 64 did it with a 6526. This should only
be considered a last resort however.  Using a real UART is much
easier from the programming perspective, allows higher speeds, and
allows the processor to work on other things between byte
transmissions or receptions. Don't confuse asynchronous serial
(like RS-232) and synchrnous serial (like SPI, &mu;Wire, and I&sup2;C).
Synchronous serial interfaces with their separate clock line usually
do not have the tight timing requirements that RS-232 does, so
they're much easier to bit-bang if you have to, and to do so at
comparatively high speeds.</P>

<P>Back to baud rate. The baud rate on this kind of communications
interface is generally the same as the number of bits per second,
since RS-232 doesn't use different levels to try to encode more than
one bit per time period. 9600 bits per second (bps), or 9600
baud, is one of the more common baud rates. Most UARTs have
speeds as slow as 50 bps in their standard choices. Above 150
bps, you keep doubling the number to get up to the next common baud
rate: 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 19200. The
&quot;standard&quot; RS-232 rates between these numbers (1800, 3600,
7200, 14400) are rarely used.</P>

<P>Since we're talking about bits per second, the amount of time, in seconds,
for each bit is 1/baud. At 9600 baud, you get 104.2
microseconds per bit. If the speed of the transmitter and
receiver disagree by more than 2-3%, the errors will start showing
up. 5% would be a half bit time by the end of the frame.
If the transmitting end were 1% below the intended speed and the
receiving end were 1% above the intended speed, you would have just
about all the error the system could tolerate and keep working
reliably under ideal conditions. To avoid problems in this
area, the UARTs' speed is normally crystal-controlled for accuracy.</P>

<P>The maximum speed allowed by the original RS-232 specification was
20kbps; but by speeding up the rise and fall times and keeping the
cables short, some products like <A HREF="http://www.divaauto.com/">Diva
Automation's</A> SuprChip (which uses the 6502) run RS-232 at up to
half a megabaud (500,000bps) or even more. The 6551's highest
standard baud rate with a standard 1.8432MHz crystal or external
oscillator is 19.2kbps, but it can go to apparently at least 125kbps
if you use the 16x external clock. This is the only way for it
to give the 31.25kbps required for MIDI (musical instrument digital
interface).</P>

<P>If you use the common configuration of start bit, 8 data bits, no parity
bit, and 1 stop bit, you have 10 bits in a frame, so the number of
bytes transferred per second is generally the baud rate divided by 10
if there are no delays between frames. 9600 baud makes for a
maximum data transfer rate of just under a thousand bytes per second.</P>

<P>In order to make the receiving part of the UART more immune to random spikes
and other interference, many UARTs (including the 6551) sample the
received data voltage many times per bit period, and then &quot;take
a vote,&quot; so to speak. This improves the trustworthiness of
the received data.</P>

<P>The transmitting standard goes like this: Logic 0 is +5V to +15V.
Logic 1 is -5V to -15V. -5V to +5V is the transition area.
Transmitters can handle indefinite shorts to each other or to ground
without damage.</P>

<P>If the line driver (remember this is normally not in the same package with
the UART) does not derive its own high voltages by way of some sort
of switched-capacitor power supply voltage booster or take power from
the receiving lines, then running the line drivers on &plusmn;12V
power supplies is pretty standard. The line drivers in
inexpensive ICs such as the 1488 and MC145406 need these
higher-voltage positive and negative voltage power supplies.
Others like the MC145407 and the well-known MAX232 derive their own
high voltages on-chip from the +5V. For low-power hand-held
applications where battery power is saved at all costs, it is also
possible to power the line drivers with power taken from the
receivers' input signals. A unit designed like this would have
to be connected to another computer that will supply the power.
Obviously it won't work if it is connected to another one of the same
which also supplies no power, especially if you have a hand-held
terminal with no power supply of its own other than the RS-232
inputs.</P>

<P>The receiving standard goes like this: Logic 0 is +3V to +25V.
Logic 1 is -3V to -25V.&nbsp; -3V to +3V is transition area.
Specified impedance for one receiver load is 3K&Omega; to 7K&Omega;.
One output can usually drive quite a few inputs (and LEDs for
troubleshooting).</P>

<P>To reduce problems with noise and interference, the receiver usually has
some hysteresis to keep its output steady at the last valid logic
level while the input is crossing that transition area, and then
outputs a fast edge to the UART when it does go to the other logic
level.</P>

<P>Again, remember that logic 1 = true = &quot;mark&quot; = hi = negative
voltage, as mixed up as that may seem; and logic 0 = false = &quot;space&quot;
= lo = positive voltage. I have found Jameco's 7-LED tester
(cat. no. 26729) to be very helpful in quickly troubleshooting basic
RS-232 problems. Each of the seven major lines is connected
through a resistor to a bi-color LED to ground. The LED lights
up green if the voltage is above ground (meaning a logic 0), and red
if the voltage is below ground (meaning a logic 1). When no
data is going across but all handshaking lines are in the true state
(ie, both ends are ready to send and receive), the TD (transmit data)
and RD (receive data) LEDs will be red, and all the others will be
green.</P>

<P>Ok, so we mentioned other connections besides ground and one for data each
direction. You might wonder why the DB-25 connectors that are
so commonly used for RS-232 have so many (25) connections.
What's the point? Well, actually they are all defined in the
standard except for four (pins 9, 10, 18, and 25) that are reserved.
It's rare to see more than &quot;the big 8&quot; in use though.</P>

<P>Remember we had alluded to ways for one piece of equipment to tell the other
one whether or not it is ready to accept more data. This is
often done in hardware, using more wires. &quot;The big 8&quot;
include not only a ground wire and a pair of wires for data (one
going each direction), but also two pairs of &quot;handshaking&quot;
lines, and one other line which is normally only used by modems.
The big 8 (plus one more) are:</P>

<center>
<IMG SRC="/tutorials/rs232/figure_4.jpg" BORDER=0>
</center>

<P>The signal names and DB-25 pin numbers shown are for DTE, which basically
means everything except modems. The signal abbreviations at the
UART itself have the bar over them (meaning negative, or inverted
logic) for all but TD, RD, and RI. Remember that the line
drivers and receivers that go between the UART and the cable are also
inverters.</P>

<P>There are many other UARTs other than the 6551, and unfortunately
California Micro Devices just discontinued hundreds of products
including the seven or so in the 65 family; but since this
description is on www.6502.org and many of the hobbyists here are
still using this UART (or ACIA) which is part of the 65 family (and
will be for a long time), it should be helpful and appropriate to add
its corresponding pin numbers to the chart. WDC plans to
re-introduce the 65c51.</P>

<P>Here's the idea. RTS was originally for putting a half-duplex modem
into transmit mode. In other words, the computer is saying, &quot;I
have data to send. Please get ready to send it for me.&quot;
CTS told the computer when the modem was ready to send (possibly
having had to wait to finish receiving some data first). Well,
like so much of today's RS-232 implementations, that specification
broke down. The function that RTS more commonly takes on today
is to tell the device at the other end of the line, &quot;Go ahead
and send data. I'm ready to take it.&quot; Then the
function that CTS more commonly takes on is to know if the device at
the other end of the line is ready to receive data.</P>

<P>DTR was used by many DTE devices to take the modem on- and off-line.
One effect is that it can tell the modem whether the computer (or
DTE) is able to accept an incoming call.  DSR tells the DTE that
the modem is connected, powered up, and ready to go; ie, not in talk,
test, or dial mode.  When neither end of the line is connected
to an actual modem, these lines generally tell the device at each end
that the device at the other end is ready for business.  So in
that case, what becomes of the difference between these and RTS/CTS?
Not much; but if the sending end tends to send data faster than the
receiving end can process it, the receiving end will be constantly
toggling its RTS output, not its DTR output. The RTS output
will go to the sender's CTS input to turn the data-sending off and on
such that we don't get the overrun errors previously mentioned.
Many of the newer UARTs do not implement DSR and DTR, only TD
RD, and RTS &amp; CTS.</P>

<P>DCD is used to let the computer know that the modem is receiving a carrier
of adequate quality for dependable communication. RI may be
used by an auto-answer modem to tell the computer that there's a ring
signal on the phone line. The computer may then use DTR to tell
the modem to answer the call. In the case where neither end of
the line has a modem on it, DCD is often just connected to DSR, and
RI is left unconnected.</P>

<P>The 6551 ACIA (UART) will not send data if CTS is not true, and it won't
receive if DCD is not true. This doesn't mean you absolutely
have to use CTS and DCD. If you only want a two- or three-wire
interface with no hardware handshaking, then ground these inputs so
the 6551 will run.</P>

<P>A note should be made here regarding CTS and the 6551. An applications
note I have here for the Synertek NMOS 6551, as well as the '87
Rockwell data book's NMOS 6551 pages say that transmission of an
already-started frame will stop immediately when CTS\ is taken false,
the byte will be lost, and the TD line will go to marking. The
same Rockwell book says that the CMOS 65c51 will finish the
already-started byte before halting transmission after CTS\ goes
false. The other data sheets I have only say CTS\ must be true
for the ACIA to transmit, without giving details of what happens when
CTS\ is taken false in the middle of a frame. My expectation
then is that regardless of brand, the CMOS ones generally will finish
the frame whereas the NMOS ones won't. If it matters in your
use, you will want to experiment with the particular brand of 6551
you have in order to make sure your program operates it correctly so
as not to lose data. If the NMOS 6551 is interrupted during a
frame transmission, the program will have to give it the same byte
again to transmit when CTS\ goes true.</P>

<P>The 6551's other three handshaking lines don't necessarily have to be
used either; but the inputs should not be left unconnected.  It
would be best to ground them if they're not connected to line
receivers. If you're making the computer, you may want to use
pin headers so you can put jumpers on the appropriate pairs of pins
to select whether or not to use CTS and DCD. If you're using
the full complement of hardware handshaking, you'll want those inputs
to be fed from the connector pins through the line receivers.
Otherwise, you'll want one or both to artificially be held true by
grounding them.</P>

<IMG SRC="/tutorials/rs232/figure_3b.jpg" ALT="(null-modem connections)">
<I>Figure 2: Null modem connections</I>

<p>Now you see the fun beginning.
There's room for confusion at every turn.  Welcome to the world
of RS-232. It may all look like a disaster, but it's usually
not really that hard to get things working together. As we said
before, most RS-232 implementations today don't have a modem at
either end of the line. Both ends of the line are generally
DTE. You no doubt noticed that if the connections are made
straight across, you'll have the TD output of one device connected to
the TD output of another. Likewise, the RD inputs of the two
will be connected together, and the handshaking lines, the same.</P>

<P>Obviously you'll need to cross the TD and RD lines so an output goes to an
input and vice-versa. What should be almost as easily understood above is 
that the same can be done with RTS and CTS.
It may not be quite as clear, but generally the same can be done with
DTR and DSR. But instead of having cables that cross the lines
between connectors at the ends and other cables that don't (to serve
as extension cords), one way to get things straight is to insert a
null modem somewhere along the line.</P>

<P>A null modem is simply a pair of connectors that cross these lines, as in
Figure 2.</P>

<P>If you're making your own computer board and anticipate the need, you
might add pin headers to make the more common DB-25 or DB-9 connector
pinouts selectable by putting the shorting blocks onto the right
pairs of header pins.  It could be done with DIP switches too,
but they take more room.</P>

<P>If you need to &quot;trick&quot; the interface more than this and need to do
some experimenting to figure it all out before making up a special
cable with unconventional connections, you can use a break-out box.
These give you the possibility of trying various connections quickly
and without soldering.  They usually have an array of LEDs on
them as well so you can immediately see what effects you're
producing. <A HREF="http://www.jameco.com/">Jameco</A> has

<p>Consider these simple examples of how the LEDs help to quickly troubleshoot 
a connection. If one end of the cable is connected to a COM port on a PC and 
the PC's handshaking outputs' LEDs are red, you probably forgot to set up the
PC's port. If the only LEDs to light up are those for the
outputs of the device at one end of the cable, it probably means you
need to insert or remove a null modem, because outputs are talking to
outputs and inputs are listening to inputs, instead of vice-versa.
If data does not keep going, you may see the a CTS or RTS LED light
up red, possibly meaning that your program is taking in enough data
to fill a buffer in RAM, but then not processing that data-- or maybe
it processes it but you forgot to make it update the buffer pointers
and tell the UART that it's ok to accept more data.

<I>Illustration 7: RS-232 mini-tester</I>

<p>On the Jameco RS-232 mini-tester at right, the unlit RD LED shows that 
the data-line transmitter at the other end is not connected.</P>

<o>Many UARTs today (for example, the MAX3100) only implement TD, RD, RTS,
and CTS, as this is usually enough.&nbsp; If you're using one of
these UARTs and really need the other lines, you would have to get
those by using a few I/O bits of a parallel port of another IC like a
6522 VIA.</p>

<P>Remember
the line drivers and receivers go <I>between</I> the DB-25 connector
and the UART. The voltages on the connector side are generally
&plusmn;10V (give or take a few volts), whereas the voltages at the
UART pins are TTL levels. The line drivers and receivers are
also inverters, and they generally are much more immune to damage
from static discharge than the UART is.</P>

<P>The well known Maxim MAX232 has two line drivers and two line receivers.
It is popular because it is one of the first widely available line
driver and receiver ICs that derived its own high voltages from the
+5V supply so the user didn't have to provide more than one power
supply voltage.</P>

<P>It should be noted however that there are many other line drivers and
receivers.  Before the MAX232 came along, hobbyists usually used
the $.27 14-pin 1488 (75188) quad line driver and $.23 1489 (75189)
quad line receiver, or the MC145406, an $.88 16-pin IC with three of
each. (These are Jameco's prices for qantities of 1-9, at the
time of this writing.) With a 1488/1489 pair, you have four
line drivers and four line receivers, just as you have with <I>two</I>
of the MAX232's at $2.19 each. The extra power supplies needed
by the 1488 and MC145406 are often available on the board anyway for
other things like op amp supplies for D/A and A/D converters.
Again, remember the voltages are not critical. For example, if
you have +9V and -7V, it should work. The positive voltage
might just be the 5V regulator's input. You might already have
the negative voltage for LCD bias.</P>

<P>It should be noted here that the 1489 has an extra input pin for each of
the four receivers. This can be used for changing the input
threshold voltage or for increasing input noise immunity. In
most cases, these pins can be left unconnected.</P>

<P>It should also be noted here that each of three of the four line drivers
in the 1488 have two inputs. If either one is pulled low, the
output will go to the high voltage. In most cases, the extra
input can be left unconnected.</P>

<H2>Construction:</H2>
<P>Unfortunately the DB-9 &amp; -25 pin spacing is .109&quot; and rows 
are staggered so they don't fit nicely into .1&quot;-grid perfboard. 
The pins of a right-angle DB-9 can sometimes be bent enough to get them into 
the holes in the perfboard, but you won't be so lucky with the DB-25.
One way to solve the problem is to use a soldercup DB-25 that is intended to be
mounted on a cable, and mount it on the board a tiny L-bracket at
each end, then solder to the connector.</P>

<I>Illustration 8: IDCs on ribbon cable: pin header to DB-9</I>

<p>Another solution is to put a
dual-row pin header on the board, and then prepare a ribbon cable
with a standard 26-contact IDC (insulation-displacement connector) at
one end and a DB-25 that's made to be mounted on ribbon cable at the
other end. For three-wire interfaces (with no hardware
handshaking), I have even used 3-conductor mini phone jacks and
plugs, using the tip for output, the center ring for input, and the
sleeve for ground. It's not standard, but it sure takes less
room on the board!</p>
