<h2><a name="toc:introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
The <a href="http://westerndesigncenter.com" target="_blank"><b>Western Design Center</b></a>'s
<a href="http://westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c816s-chip.cfm" target="_blank"><b>W65C816S microprocessor</b></a>
(hereafter referred to as the 65C816) extends the 65C02 eight bit microprocessor
to a 16 bit capable device with added instructions and features.&nbsp;
Among those features are interrupt processing capabilities that have no analog in 
the eight bit 6502 family.&nbsp;
These capabilities can be harnessed in concert with other 65C816-unique features,
such as stack pointer relative addressing, to create advanced software routines
that can assist in complex operating system and device driver development.&nbsp;
When applied to existing interrupt-driven functions, execution speed improvements
and reductions in code size are possible with a modicum of effort.
<br>
<br>
Before you start reading please understand that <b><i>this article is not a 
general 6502 interrupt primer</i></b>, nor does it discuss operation of the 
65C816 in its 65C02 emulation mode.&nbsp;
Everything herein pertains to native mode operation only, although some of the
discussion on coding style is certainly applicable to any member of the 6502 family.
<br>
<br>
Although this article will present some material on the electrical 
characteristics of the 65C816's interrupt inputs and the circuits to 
which they may be connected, hardware design will be largely ignored.&nbsp; 
Much of this discussion will also be applicable to the W65C802, which is
an obsolete W65C02S plug-compatible form of the 65C816.&nbsp;
As the 65C802 was designed to replace a W65C02S in-circuit, some hardware signals 
described herein are not present.
<br>
<br>
In writing this article, we have assumed that you are a reasonably 
proficient programmer who knows the 65C816 assembly language, has 
developed a sound coding style, knows what an interrupt is and 
understands why computers use interrupts.&nbsp;
If these assumptions don't describe you then you need to seek out other references
before continuing.&nbsp;
One such reference is Garth Wilson's <a target="_blank" href="http://wilsonminesco.com/6502interrupts/index.html"><b>6502 interrupt primer</b></a>,
which starts with the basics and explains in detail how the 6502 family behaves when interrupted.&nbsp;
Code examples of common interrupt-driven tasks that would be performed in a typical
6502-powered system are also presented and in many cases, can be pasted directly
into your assembly language programs.&nbsp;
Enjoy the 1980s-style cartoons as well!
<br>
<br>
<b><i>We caution that if you do not understand the concepts presented in 
Garth's primer then you will experience difficulty in understanding the 
material presented herein</i></b>.&nbsp;
This article has not been written to the level of a novice.&nbsp; An 
enormous amount of information about the 6502 family can be found both in
printed form and on-line, as it is arguably the most documented microprocessor family ever developed.&nbsp;
Two good places at which to start looking on-line are <a target="_blank" href="http://6502.org"><b>6502.org</b></a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://wilsonminesco.com"><b>wilsonminesco.com</b></a>,
the latter which is Garth Wilson's extensive 6502-oriented website.&nbsp;
Or enter "65C816" into your favorite search engine.
<br>
<br>
For a general reference to the 6502 family assembly language, we recommend the
Western Design Center's <a target="_blank" href="http://65xx.com/65xx-store-2/65xxcoding/"><b>programming reference manual</b></a>.&nbsp;
Encompassing some 450 pages, this manual has a wealth of information for the beginning 6502 assembly language programmer, as well considerable detail for those who already know the 6502 assembly language and want to get the most out of the 65C816.
<br>
<br>
All 65C816 assembly language examples will use MOS Technology standard assembler syntax, which has been carried forward with suitable modifications to account 
for 24 bit operands and new addressing modes by WDC in their syntax standard for the 65C816.&nbsp; If your assembler conforms to this standard, great!&nbsp; If not, you may have to do some adjusting to code examples.

A brief digression on the <tt>DB</tt> and <tt>PB</tt> registers:<br>
<blockquote>During program execution, the effective program address (<tt>EPA</tt>) seen by other hardware in the system is the 16 bit content in <tt>PC</tt> catenated with the eight bit content in <tt>PB</tt>, resulting in a 24 bit address in which <tt>PB</tt> 
represents bits 16-23 and <tt>PC</tt> represents bits 0-15.&nbsp;
The <tt>EPA</tt> is where the 65C816 will fetch an instruction opcode and its operand, if any.&nbsp;
Note that there is no direct programmatic means by which the content of <tt>PB</tt> can be changed.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, the effective data address (<tt>EDA</tt>) is the concatenation of the value in <tt>DB</tt>,
which represents bits 16-23, with the 16 bit address derived from a 16 bit address
operand, or from a 16 bit address stored in a pair of contiguous direct page locations,
resulting in a <tt>24</tt> bit address from which data will be read or written.&nbsp;
<tt>EDA</tt> and <tt>EPA</tt> are always <tt>$00xxxx</tt> in a system in which no bank latching hardware is 
present, regardless of the actual values in <tt>DB</tt> and <tt>PB</tt>.&nbsp; Furthermore, the value in <tt>DB</tt> will be ignored if an instruction has a 24 bit operand or if the addressing mode involves direct page, for example, <tt>LDA $12</tt>.&nbsp; Direct page and hardware stack accesses are always addressed to bank <tt>$00</tt>.

<h2><a name="toc:interrupts"></a>65C816 INTERRUPTS</h2>
As is typical of almost all microprocessors, the 65C816's interrupt types broadly fall into two classes: hardware and software.<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>A hardware interrupt occurs when a specific electrical input on the 
65C816 is asserted by other hardware in the system</b>, such as an 
input/output (I/O) device.&nbsp; <b><i>Asserted</i></b> means the input
 has been brought to
 state that is opposite of the normal or quiescent operating 
state.&nbsp; 6502 family interrupt inputs are quiescent when at logic 
one, which is 
approximately five volts in many applications, and thus are brought low 
(logic zero, which is near zero volts) when asserted, a type of logic 
referred to as "low-true."&nbsp; The manner in which the 65C816 reacts 
to a 
hardware interrupt is determined by which input has been asserted and in
 some cases, by when the input has been asserted relative to the 
instruction cycle.&nbsp; Hardware interrupts are asynchronous in 
nature, meaning they must be expected to occur at any time with no 
advance warning to a running program (the "foreground task").
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>A software interrupt is caused by the 65C816 executing a program 
instruction that triggers an interrupt-like sequence in the 
microprocessor's internal circuits</b>.&nbsp; As software interrupts are 
generated under program control, they are synchronous, which means the executing
program will always "know" when one is going to occur.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="toc:interrupt_hard"></a>Hardware Interrupts</h3>
The 65C816 has four hardware interrupt inputs, summarized as follows:

Some key points related to the above follow:
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Interrupt mnemonic</i></b> is a convenient way to refer to the interrupt in a
 textual context.&nbsp; Saying "NMI" or "IRQ" is more convenient than 
"non-maskable interrupt" or "interrupt request."&nbsp; An interrupt mnemonic 
is also useful in hardware electrical schematics.&nbsp; In such cases, it is 
customary to add a symbol that indicates the low-true nature of the 
signal, such as <tt>/NMI</tt> or <tt>*NMI</tt>. Overlining, for example, <span style="text-decoration: overline;"><tt>NMI</tt></span>, is often found in typeset literature, but rarely seen in schematics.
<br>
<br>
  </li>
  <li><b><i>Input type</i></b> refers to the nature of the electrical signal that is 
required for the 65C816 to recognize that it is being interrupted:<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li><b><i>Level</i></b> means the 65C816 responds to the interrupt input any time 
the signal level is logic zero or low.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li><b><i>Edge</i></b> means the 65C816 responds to the interrupt input only when 
the signal level makes a transition from logic one (high) to logic zero.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>While no attempt will be made here to delve into the more arcane 
aspects of interrupt circuit design, understanding the characteristics 
of level versus edge sensitive interrupt inputs, as well as other factors, is essential to writing a
 trouble-free interrupt service routine, especially for a system that 
will run at a high &Oslash;2 rate (the 65C816 has been successfully operated at
 speeds as high as 20 megahertz (MHz) in commercial products, and much higher speeds
 are attainable in FPGA designs).&nbsp; Some discussion on this will be 
presented later on.
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Input name</i></b> is the official designation in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/documentation/w65c816s.pdf"><b>65C816 data sheet</b></a> of 
the chip pin corresponding to the interrupt input.&nbsp; In WDC data 
sheets, a <b><tt>B</tt></b> on the end of the input name, for example, <tt>IRQB</tt>, signifies 
that it is a low-true input.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Each interrupt input is associated with a specific hardware vector 
from which the 65C816 will get the address of the corresponding 
interrupt service routine.&nbsp; <b><i>The listed hardware vectors are for native 
mode operation only</i></b>, with one exception: the reset vector is the same 
for both native and emulation modes, as the 65C816 is reverted to 
emulation mode when <tt>RESB</tt> is asserted.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the event two or more interrupt inputs are simultaneously 
asserted, the 65C816 will respond in a defined order, that is, it will 
give interrupts a response priority:
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><tt>RESB</tt></li>
    <li><tt>ABORTB</tt></li>
    <li><tt>NMIB</tt></li>
    <li><tt>IRQB</tt><br>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>This list simply means that if, for example, <tt>ABORTB</tt> and <tt>NMIB</tt> are 
simultaneously asserted, the 65C816 will respond to <tt>ABORTB</tt> and then upon
 completion of the abort interrupt service routine, will respond to 
  <tt>NMIB</tt>, assuming that <tt>NMIB</tt> is still asserted.<br>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Normally, the 65C816 doesn't "look" at its interrupt inputs until 
the currently executing instruction has been completed.&nbsp; When response 
to an interrupt does occur, the 65C816 has to save its state on the 
stack before loading the interrupt vector and proceeding.&nbsp; If the 65C816
 is operating in native mode, eight &Oslash;2 clock cycles will be consumed in 
responding to the interrupt and saving state.&nbsp; If the interrupt happens 
to occur just as the current instruction's opcode is being fetched, as 
many as eight additional &Oslash;2 cycles may elapse before interrupt 
recognition.&nbsp; Therefore, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_latency" target="_blank""><b>interrupt latency</b></a> of as many as 16 &Oslash;2 cycles is possible, depending on the instruction being executed and when 
during the instruction sequence the interrupt input is asserted.&nbsp; The 
effects of variable interrupt latency will be discussed later on.</li>
</ul>
A more detailed explanation of each interrupt type follows.&nbsp;
In the lists that describe the sequence of actions for each interrupt type, the
 event numbers are merely for list purposes, and do not imply how many 
&Oslash;2 clock cycles have elapsed at any given point in the sequence.
<ul>
  <li><b><a name="toc:interrupt_abort"></a>Abort</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>The abort interrupt is used in systems that have specialized memory 
management logic to cope with unusual hardware conditions that may arise
 during program execution.&nbsp; In such systems, an abort interrupt might be
 triggered if a running program accesses memory that either doesn't

limited to describing how the 65C816 reacts when <tt>ABORTB</tt> is asserted.&nbsp; If
 you are sufficiently hardware-savvy to be able to design a system that 
can take advantage of this interrupt then it is a sure bet you won't need

completed before the 65C816 reacts to the interrupt.&nbsp; What is aborted 
are computational changes to a register and/or memory that the

strict timing requirements relative to the instruction sequence that 
must be satisfied in order to assure that the above behavior will 
actually occur.&nbsp; Understanding these requirements and the character of 
an abort interrupt is crucial to being able to design a system that can 
support hardware memory protection and/or instruction execution 
trapping.<br>

<ul>
<li><b><a name="toc:interrupt_irq"></a>Interrupt request
    </b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>An interrupt request (IRQ) is also referred to as a maskable 
interrupt, which means the microprocessor can be made to ignore an IRQ.&nbsp; 
 As the <tt>IRQB</tt> input is level-sensitive, it is practical to connect 
multiple interrupt sources to it in a configuration referred to as 
"wired-OR."&nbsp; In a typical wired-OR configuration, the interrupt service 
routine has to determine which devices are interrupting by using a 
procedure referred to as "polling."&nbsp; More advanced systems may include 
hardware that can tell the 65C816 which device has interrupted, which 
helps to reduce software-induced interrupt latency by eliminating the 
necessity of polling each possible IRQ source.&nbsp; If <tt>IRQB</tt> is still low 
after an interrupt source has been serviced and cleared, a new IRQ will 
occur.<br>
  <br>
In most systems, an IRQ is the primary means by which input/output 
(I/O) devices get the 65C816's attention when they need service.&nbsp; For 
example, a disk controller would assert <tt>IRQB</tt> to indicate that it is 
ready for some data.&nbsp; Or serial interface hardware, such as a UART 
(<b>U</b>niversal <b>A</b>synchronous <b>R</b>eceiver/<b>T</b>ransmitter),
may interrupt when a user types at a terminal.&nbsp;
In many systems, a hardware timer running at a 
constant rate generates a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiffy_%28time%29#Computing"><b>jiffy IRQ</b></a> that is used for general 
timekeeping, process scheduling, etc.&nbsp; Therefore, an IRQ service routine
 may be quite complex and lengthy, and could involve considerable hardware 
interaction, depending on the number and nature of the I/O devices in 
the system.<br>
  <br>
When the 65C816 receives an interrupt request, the following actions
 occur:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>All steps of the current instruction are completed and memory 
and/or registers are updated as required.</li>
    <li>The <tt>I</tt> bit in <tt>SR</tt> is tested and if set, the IRQ is ignored&mdash;none of
 the following steps will be executed.</li>
    <li>If the <tt>I</tt> bit in SR is clear the 65C816 will process the 
interrupt and start by pushing <tt>PB</tt> to the stack.</li>
    <li><tt>PC</tt>, which is pointing to the next instruction to be executed, is
 pushed to the stack, MSB first followed by LSB.</li>
    <li><tt>SR</tt> is pushed to the stack.</li>

<ul>
  <li><b><a name="toc:interrupt_nmi"></a>Non-maskable interrupt</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>A non-maskable interrupt (NMI) is similar to an IRQ in effect, 
except there is no programmatic means by which an NMI can be blocked.&nbsp; 
Typically, an NMI would be used to interrupt the microprocessor in 
response to one very high priority event.&nbsp; For example, NMIB may be 
driven by a timekeeper so as to guarantee that the device is immediately
 serviced when it interrupts.&nbsp; Although multiple interrupt sources may 
be connected to NMIB in a wired-OR configuration, such an arrangement 
will be problematic, as <tt>NMIB</tt> is edge-sensitive.&nbsp; Unless all NMI sources 
are checked and cleared by the NMI service routine, the 65C816 will not 
respond to another NMI, since <tt>NMIB</tt> will continue to be held at logic zero by the 
device that wasn't serviced.&nbsp; In many 6502-based homebrew computers,
 <tt>NMIB</tt> is not used at all or is wired to a push button circuit so the 
user can interrupt a runaway program and regain control.<br>
<br>
When the 65C816 receives a non-maskable interrupt, the following 
actions occur:<br>
<ol>
  <li>All steps of the current instruction are completed and memory or
 registers are updated as required.</li>

executing an <tt>RTI</tt> instruction, the above sequence will be logically 
reversed to return the 65C816 to the state it was in at the time of the 
NMI, and unless the address that was pushed to the stack in steps 2 and 3
 is altered within the interrupt service routine, the 65C816  will 
execute the next instruction in the interrupted program.

<ul>
  <li><b><a name="toc:interrupt_reset"></a>Reset</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Although you may not consider a reset to be an interrupt, 
  <tt>RESB</tt> is an interrupt input and triggers some internal  actions that are 
like those of other interrupt types.&nbsp; In the overwhelming majority of 
applications, <tt>RESB</tt> is wired to a circuit that includes a push-button for
 manual restarting of the system.&nbsp; The same circuit is usually designed 
to hold <tt>RESB</tt> low for a short period of time after power is applied so 
that all voltages and other circuit conditions will have time to 
stabilize before the 65C816 commences code execution.&nbsp; Embedded 
controller applications may use <tt>RESB</tt> as an actual interrupt in cases 
where the controller idles for long periods of time awaiting activity 
and the 65C816 has been stopped to conserve power while waiting.&nbsp; Some 
controllers may have a watchdog timer wired to <tt>RESB</tt> to force a restart 
if system fatality occurs.<br>
  <br>
When <tt>RESB</tt> is brought low the 65C816 will immediately halt whatever 
it is doing and remain in a halted state as long as <tt>RESB</tt> is held low.&nbsp; 
Upon release of <tt>RESB</tt>, the following actions will occur:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>The internal clock, which is driven by the &Oslash;2 clock generator 
circuit, will be restarted if it had previously been stopped by an <tt>STP</tt> 
or <tt>WAI</tt> instruction (described in the <a href="#toc:high_speed_interrupt"><b>high speed interrupt response

    <li>The <tt>I</tt> bit in <tt>SR</tt> will be set.</li>
    <li>The <tt>D</tt> bit in <tt>SR</tt> will be cleared.</li>
    <li>The hidden <tt>E</tt> (emulation) bit in <tt>SR</tt> will be set, causing the 
65C816 to revert to W65C02S emulation mode.</li>
    <li>The <tt>m</tt> and <tt>x</tt> bits in <tt>SR</tt> will be set and made inaccessible, thus 
forcing the accumulator and index register sizes to eight bits.</li>
    <li><tt>DB</tt> and <tt>PB</tt> will be set to <tt>$00</tt>, thus "hard wiring" all accesses to
 bank <tt>$00</tt> and limiting the highest accessible address to <tt>$00FFFF</tt>.</li>
    <li><tt>DP</tt> will be set to <tt>$0000</tt>, thus "hard wiring" direct page program 
references to the physical zero page in RAM.</li>
    <li>The MSB of <tt>SP</tt> will be set to <tt>$01</tt>, thus "hard wiring" the stack 
to <tt>$000100</tt>-<tt>$0001FF</tt> in RAM.</li>

The LSB of <tt>SP</tt> is undefined following a reset and must be explicitly

</blockquote>
Again, note that the listed hardware vectors apply only to native mode operation.&nbsp;
Key points are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Both <tt>BRK</tt> and <tt>COP</tt> cause hardware interrupt-like sequences to occur in
 the 65C816, as will be shortly described.<br><br>
  </li>
  <li><tt>BRK</tt> and <tt>COP</tt> are treated as two byte instructions by the 65C816.&nbsp; 
However, standard assembly language syntax for <tt>BRK</tt> usually doesn't 
accept an operand, although one may be added by the programmer using an 
appropriate assembler pseudo-op.&nbsp; <tt>COP</tt>, on the other hand, must be 
assembled with an operand.&nbsp; The byte that follows <tt>BRK</tt> or <tt>COP</tt> is 
customarily referred to as a "signature byte."<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Unlike the eight bit 6502 family members, the 65C816's <tt>BRK</tt> 
instruction has its own hardware vector when operating in native mode.&nbsp; 
This features eliminates the need to examine the stack copy of the 
status register to differentiate between an interrupt caused by <tt>BRK</tt> and 
one caused by asserting <tt>IRQB</tt>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Software interrupts are preempted by hardware interrupts if one of 
the latter occurs during the opcode fetch part of an instruction cycle.&nbsp;
For example, if <tt>IRQB</tt> is asserted at the same time the 65C816 is fetching a 
    <tt>COP</tt> opcode, the IRQ will be processed first.&nbsp; Only after the IRQ service
 routine has exited with <tt>RTI</tt> will the <tt>COP</tt> instruction be executed.</li>
</ul>
A more detailed explanation of COP and BRK follows.
<ul>
  <li><b><a name="toc:interrupt_brk"></a>Break</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><tt>BRK</tt> is the "traditional" software interrupt with which all 6502 
assembly language programmers are, or should be, familiar.&nbsp; <tt>BRK</tt> is most 
commonly used during software debugging to stop the program undergoing 
testing and start a machine language monitor to inspect memory and/or 
the microprocessor's registers.&nbsp; In the past, <tt>BRK</tt> was used to patch
 PROMs when program bugs were discovered,&nbsp; a practice that was obsoleted 
when EPROMs became readily available.&nbsp; In some cases, <tt>BRK</tt> has been used 
as a supervisor call instruction to invoke operating system services.
<br>
<br>
Upon executing <tt>BRK</tt> the following actions occur:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><tt>PB</tt> is pushed to the stack.</li>
    <li><tt>PC</tt> is double incremented and then pushed to the stack, MSB first, followed by LSB.</li>

reversed to return the 65C816 to the state it was in at the time of the 
interrupt, and unless the address that was pushed to the stack in steps 1
and 2 is altered within the interrupt service routine, the 65C816 will 
execute the next instruction in the interrupted program.&nbsp; As <tt>PC</tt> is twice
incremented before being pushed to the stack, the "next instruction" 
will be at the address of the <tt>BRK</tt> instruction plus two.&nbsp; The interceding
 signature byte is ignored by the 65C816 and can be anything&mdash;a <tt>NOP</tt> (<tt>$EA</tt>)
 is customary during debugging, unless the <tt>BRK</tt> handler refers to the 
signature.<br>
  <br>
It is important to note that IRQs will be masked by executing <tt>BRK</tt>, 
which means that if <tt>BRK</tt> is intercepted by a machine language monitor it 
is essential that IRQs be re-enabled.&nbsp; Otherwise, all interrupt-driven 
I/O operations will cease and the system will most likely be 
unresponsive.<br>

another software interrupt, and it is up to the imagination of the

<h2><a name="toc:software_engineering"></a>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h2>
A well-designed interrupt service routine represents a significant 
challenge for many programmers&mdash;as well as an occasionally rude lesson on
 the value of disciplined coding habits.&nbsp; In addition to meeting the 
obvious requirement of being able to correctly service and clear interrupts, an 
interrupt service routine should be:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#toc:transparent"><b>Transparent</b></a><br>
    <br>

  <li><a href="#toc:reentrant"><b>Reentrant</b></a><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><b><a href="#toc:succinct">Succinct</a>
    </b>
  </li>
</ul>
Other characteristics may well be required, but the above three are the 
most important in most systems.&nbsp; Let's take a closer look at this.
<h3><a name="toc:transparent"></a>Transparency</h3>
An interrupt service routine is said to be "transparent" if it does not 
affect the environment of the interrupted foreground task in any way.&nbsp; 
In order for the foreground task to be able to be restarted without 
error following an interrupt, the interrupt service routine must 
preserve the state of the microprocessor at the time of the interrupt 
and must restore that state when interrupt processing has been 
completed.&nbsp; Also, transparency requires that the interrupt service 
routine use no memory other than the hardware stack, except in 
well-defined cases that are acceptable to interrupted foreground tasks.&nbsp; 
 Otherwise, memory locations being used in the foreground may randomly 
change for no apparent reason, creating a potential debugging nightmare.
<br>
<br>
Getting back to preservation of the microprocessor's state, the 
interrupt service routine must make sure that whatever values were in 
the registers at the time of the interrupt are there when execution of 
the foreground task resumes.&nbsp; Some of this preservation process is 
automatically handled by the 65C816 when it acknowledges an interrupt, 
as it will push <tt>PB</tt>, <tt>PC</tt>, and <tt>SR</tt> to the stack prior to executing the 
interrupt service routine.&nbsp;
However, as already noted, the 65C816 doesn't preserve any of its other 
registers, which means the interrupt service routine must see to that 
chore.&nbsp; Which registers must be preserved and restored will be 
implementation-dependent.
<br>
<br>
As a fairly rigid rule, any register that 
will be "touched" (changed) within an interrupt service routine must be 
preserved to assure transparency in all cases.&nbsp; Preservation is 
accomplished by pushing the registers to the stack before being touched 
and pulling them from the stack when the interrupt service routine has 
completed its work.&nbsp; <b><i>Note that it is not necessary to preserve a 
register that the interrupt service routine does not touch</i></b>.&nbsp; For 
example, if your interrupt service routine only uses <tt>.X</tt> and <tt>.Y</tt>, there's 
no good reason to preserve the accumulator&mdash;doing so would simply waste 
valuable clock cycles and stack space.&nbsp; If you can guarantee that your 
interrupt service routine will not touch any of the registers, a 
possibility in some tightly-written embedded applications, do not waste 
time preserving them.
<br>
<br>
The 65C816 slightly complicates register preservation because the 
accumulator and index registers may be set to either eight or 16 bits at the
 time of the interrupt.&nbsp; Therefore, the interrupt service routine has to
 be careful to not make any assumptions in that regard, lest data be 
lost.&nbsp; This is especially true when the accumulator is considered, as it
 is really two registers designated <tt>.A</tt> and <tt>.B</tt>.&nbsp; Pushing the accumulator 
when it has been set to eight bits (<tt>m=1</tt> in <tt>SR</tt>) will not preserve <tt>.B</tt>, 
which could result in a loss of transparency should the interrupt 
service routine touch <tt>.B</tt>.&nbsp; Therefore, it is essential that the 
accumulator be set to 16 bits before preservation and restoration if the 
interrupt service routine will be using <tt>.B</tt>.&nbsp; Also, beware of 
changes to <tt>.B</tt> via the <tt>TDC</tt>, <tt>TSC</tt> and <tt>XBA</tt> instructions.&nbsp; <tt>TDC</tt> and <tt>TSC</tt> are 
particularly sneaky, in that they result in a 16 bit transfer that overwrites <tt>.B</tt>, regardless of the status of the <tt>m</tt> bit in <tt>SR</tt>.
<br>
<br>
A non-obvious problem that confronts the 65C816 assembly language programmer is the 
fact that there is no way to conveniently determine the register widths 
in the interrupt service routine except by examining the <tt>m</tt> and <tt>x</tt> bits in
 <tt>SR</tt>.&nbsp; However, doing so requires that <tt>SR</tt> be pushed to the stack and then
 retrieved in the (eight bit) accumulator for analysis, causing the 
value in <tt>.A</tt> to be lost before it is preserved.&nbsp; This problem is best 
circumvented by assuming that the registers are set to 16 bits at the 
time of the interrupt, which simply means that the <tt>m</tt> and <tt>x</tt> bits in <tt>SR</tt> 
should be cleared before pushing the registers, and 
again cleared before pulling them at the end of the interrupt service routine.&nbsp;
  Doing so adds extra instructions and some clock cycles to the 
interrupt service routine, but does guarantee full register 
preservation.
<br>
<br>
For most applications, the following code will completely preserve the 
65C816's state at the beginning of an interrupt service routine:
<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
phb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;save DB</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
phd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;save DP</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rep 
#%00110000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;select 16 bit 
registers</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
pha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;save .C</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
phx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;save .X</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
phy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;save .Y</tt>
</blockquote>
If the interrupt service routine has a stack separate from other stacks,
preservation of <tt>SP</tt> must occur in memory after the above pushes have 
been completed.&nbsp;
The following code, added to the above sequence, would handle this requirement:
<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
tsc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;copy SP to .C &amp;...</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sta 
sp_fgnd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
;save somewhere in safe RAM</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lda 
sp_isr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;get ISR's stack pointer &amp;...</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
tcs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;set new stack location</tt>
</blockquote>
There are several items to consider:
<ul>
  <li>As previously noted, <b><i>you should preserve only the registers that 
your interrupt service routine will be touching</i></b>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In a system with more than 64 kilobytes of RAM that is running 
multiple processes, it is quite possible that the interrupt service 
routine may need to load a different bank into <tt>DB</tt> in order to access a different process' 
data, hence the preservation of the data bank with the <tt>PHB</tt> instruction.&nbsp; Otherwise, <tt>PHB</tt> can be omitted if a 
change to <tt>DB</tt> isn't necessary during interrupt processing, or if the 
system has no more than 64 kilobytes of RAM.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Preservation of the direct page pointer (the <tt>PHD</tt> instruction) is 
necessary if the interrupt service routine has been assigned its own 
direct page.&nbsp; However, use of direct page in this fashion, while 
preserving transparency, may prevent your code from <a href="#toc:reentrant"><b>being reentrant</b></a>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A 65C816-powered system without benefit of special hardware logic 
will direct all stack accesses to RAM bank <tt>$00</tt>, regardless of the amount
 of RAM actually present.&nbsp; It may be advantageous in some cases to 
change the stack pointer after register preservation has been 
accomplished to prevent interrupt service routine stack accesses from 
inadvertently affecting the foreground task(s) stack(s).&nbsp; However, doing
 so may compromise transparency and most likely will prevent 
    <a href="#toc:reentrant"><b>reentrancy</b></a>&mdash;use caution.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>If you do assign a separate stack area to the 
interrupt service routine <b><i>you must preserve the old stack pointer in 
RAM, not on the stack</i></b>.&nbsp; The following code will work but will also 
create an intractable problem:
<br>
<br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rep #%00100000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;16 bit accumulator</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
tsc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;copy SP to .C &amp;...</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
pha&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;save on stack</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lda 
sp_isr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;get ISR's stack pointer &amp;...</tt><tt><br>
    </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
tcs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;set new stack location</tt>
<br>
<br>
As the <tt>TCS</tt> instruction will set a new stack pointer, how would you 
reverse the <tt>PHA</tt> instruction that pushed the foreground task's stack 
pointer to the foreground task's stack?</li>
</ul>
At the completion of the interrupt service routine, the above steps 
would be reversed as follows:
<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rep #%00110000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;16 bit registers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lda 
sp_fgnd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;get
 foreground task's SP &amp;...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
tcs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;set it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
ply&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;restore .Y<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
plx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;restore .X<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
pla&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;restore .C<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
pld&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;restore DP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
plb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;restore DB<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
rti&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;resume foreground task</tt>
</blockquote>
Again, omit any steps that involve registers that weren't touched by the interrupt service routine.&nbsp;
Note that upon executing <tt>RTI</tt>, the 65C816 will automatically restore the correct register sizes,
since pulling <tt>SR</tt> restores the state of the <tt>m</tt> and <tt>x</tt> bits to what existed at the time of 
the interrupt.
<br>
<br>
For programming convenience, you may wish to write a single interrupt 
service routine exit point, which would encompass the above 
instructions, except for the stack pointer restoration:
<blockquote><tt>;crti: COMMON INTERRUPT RETURN<br>
;<br>

</blockquote>
As the IRQ handler typically sees much more activity than the other 
interrupt service routines in most systems, <tt>CRTI</tt> (<b>C</b>ommon <b>R</b>e<b>T</b>urn from <b>
I</b>nterrupt) should be in-line with the IRQ handler to reduce execution 
time&mdash;that is, the IRQ handler should be able to "fall through" to <tt>CRTI</tt> 
to avoid the time penalty of a branch or jump instruction.&nbsp; Other 
interrupt service routines should use <tt>BRA</tt>, <tt>BRL</tt> or <tt>JMP</tt> to get to <tt>CRTI</tt>, 
with <tt>BRA</tt> being preferred.&nbsp; Avoid use of <tt>BRL</tt> in interrupt service routines unless you are writing relocatable code.&nbsp; <tt>BRL</tt> uses four &Oslash;2 cycles, whereas <tt>BRA</tt> and <tt>JMP</tt> use three.
<h3><a name="toc:reentrant"></a>Reentrancy</h3>
An interrupt service routine is said to be "reentrant" if it can be 
interrupted and made to process a new interrupt without disturbing any 
work that was in progress on behalf of the most recent interrupt.&nbsp; 
Depending on how interrupt processing has been arranged, such "nested 
interrupts" may occur even in small systems.<br>
<br>
For example, consider a system in which a 65C51 UART is communicating 
with a modem, while a 65C22 VIA (<b>V</b>ersatile <b>I</b>nterface <b>A</b>dapter)
 is responsible for generating a jiffy IRQ
 to maintain system timekeeping.&nbsp; Let's suppose the VIA generates a
timer underflow IRQ.&nbsp; As soon as the VIA's interrupt status 
register has
 been examined in the interrupt service routine and the timer IRQ has 
been cleared, let's also suppose IRQs are re-enabled and immediately 
thereafter, the UART interrupts because it has received a byte from the 
modem.&nbsp; If the interrupt service routine is fully reentrant, the 
UART 
interrupt will be serviced without delay and then the 65C816 will pick 
up where it left off while servicing the VIA interrupt (incidentally, 
this scenario implies that the UART has a higher interrupt priority than
 the VIA, which given the limitations of the 65C51, represents a sound 
software engineering decision).&nbsp; The amount of this sort of 
interrupt 
nesting that is possible is primarily limited by stack space, which is 
far less a concern with the 65C816 than with its eight bit cousins.<br>
<br>
Reentrancy can only be achieved by fully satisfying the goal of 
transparency, especially the requirement that no memory except the 
hardware stack be used for storing temporary data.&nbsp; The 65C816's stack 
pointer relative addressing instructions, such as <tt>LDA (&lt;offset&gt;</tt><tt>,S),Y</tt>, perform both direct and indirect loads and stores on the stack, with 
indirection facilitating the use of the stack as a fugacious
direct page.&nbsp; Stack addressing in the context of interrupt processing 
will be extensively covered in the <a href="#toc:advanced_swi"><b>advanced software interrupt programming</b></a> section.
<br>
<h3><a name="toc:succinct"></a>Succinctness</h3>
Interrupt service routines need to execute as quickly as possible, as 
the time required to process interrupts is time that is not available to
 run foreground tasks.&nbsp; During the design of an interrupt service 
routine, consideration must be given to how often the routine will be 
executed in a given period of time.&nbsp; For example, in most systems, the 
NMI handler may not see much use, but the IRQ handler might be executed 
thousands or even tens of thousands of times per second.&nbsp; Clearly, any 
effort expended on improving the execution speed of the NMI handler 
would be better applied to the IRQ handler's code.<br>
  <br>
Unfortunately, the goal of succinctness can be elusive&mdash;there is usually
 a tradeoff between code size and speed.  However, with the 65C816 there
 are often ways to improve speed and reduce code size at the same time:
<ul>
  <li><b>If you need to increment or decrement a value, avoid loading that 
value into a register</b>:<br>
    <br>

 but often forget about it:<br>

<blockquote>unless, of course, you need the new value in <tt>COUNTER</tt> loaded into <tt>.X</tt>

  <blockquote><b>Caution</b>: Using any read-modify-write (R-M-W) instruction, such as 
      <tt>ASL</tt> or <tt>INC</tt>, on I/O device registers may cause unexpected behavior.<br>

  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>Use <tt>BIT</tt> to test a hardware register if the actual register value

<blockquote>Many 6502 family hardware devices, such as the 65C22, indicate that 
they are interrupting by setting bit 7 in a flag register&mdash;bit 7 is 
logically wired to the device's <span style="text-decoration: overline;"><tt>IRQ</tt></span> output.&nbsp; Owing to how the flag bits 
are arranged in the register, it may be possible to determine the reason
 why the device is interrupting solely by the effect of a <tt>BIT</tt> 
instruction, eliminating the need to load the register into .A and apply
 Boolean operations.<br>
  
  <blockquote><b>Caution</b>: The register contents may be cleared by the <tt>BIT</tt> operation, 
clearing the interrupting condition as well.<br>

<ul>

uses nearly twice as much time just to increment the 16 bit <tt>COUNTER</tt> and 
adding insult to injury, suffers an additional performance penalty due 
to the branch instruction, since the branch will be taken during 255 consecutive
 passes through the code.<br>
  </blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><b>Don't use 16 bit operations unless necessary</b>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Yes, this advice seems to contradict the previous bit of wisdom.&nbsp; 
However, if a sequence of operations can be performed with eight bit 
memory accesses, there's nothing to be gained by employing 
16 bit loads and stores.&nbsp;
All 16 bit operations on memory incur a one clock 
cycle penalty due to the extra access required to load or store the MSB.&nbsp;
  Also, any 16 bit immediate mode instruction will obviously require a 
16 bit operand&mdash;even if the operand's MSB is <tt>$00</tt>, increasing the size of 
the instruction, as well as the time required to decode and execute it.<br>

"long" operations, a performance gain can usually be realized by 
temporarily setting <tt>DB</tt> to the target bank, using 16 bit accesses on the 
target locations and then restoring <tt>DB</tt>.&nbsp; For

interrupt that never existed.<br>
  <br>
Spurious interrupts are occasionally 
caused by a number of factors related to chip timing (or more rarely, chip 
errata), but are most often due to interrupt circuit electrical 
characteristics.&nbsp; As earlier stated, this article isn't about hardware 
design.&nbsp; However, knowing something about the way in which wired-OR 
interrupt circuits behave can assist in avoiding spurious interrupts.<br>
  <br>
A wired-OR interrupt circuit connects the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collector"><b>open collector</b></a> interrupt 
outputs of multiple chips to an interrupt input on the microprocessor.&nbsp; 
"Open collector" means that unless a chip is actively interrupting, its 
interrupt output appears to be an open circuit, causing it to have no 
measurable effect on the system.&nbsp; This arrangement allows multiple 
interrupting devices to control a common interrupt input, reducing the 
parts count in the circuit.&nbsp; Any or all of the chips can simultaneously 
interrupt the microprocessor with no mutual interference.<br>
  <br>
As earlier explained, the microprocessor expects each of its interrupt 
inputs to be at a logic one voltage level when no interrupt is pending.&nbsp; 
 As an open-collector device cannot actively drive a circuit to logic 
one, a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor"><b>pull-up resistor</b></a> that connects the interrupt circuit to the 
computer's voltage source (Vcc) is used to maintain a logic one state 
when no interrupt is pending.&nbsp; When a chip does interrupt, it will pull 
the circuit down to logic zero, with the pull-up resistor limiting the 
current flow to a safe level.&nbsp; The microprocessor will recognize this 
state as an interrupt pending.<br>
  <br>
In theory, the transition from logic zero back to logic one that occurs 
when an wired-OR interrupt source is cleared is instantaneous.&nbsp; In 
practice, a phenomenon referred to as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_capacitance"><b>parasitic or stray capacitance</b></a> 
will cause some delay before logic one is attained.&nbsp; Parasitic 
capacitance has to be charged up to Vcc through the pull-up resistor, 
which takes a measurable amount of time, this time being defined as the 
circuit's <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_time_constant"><b>R-C time-constant</b></a> (R-C means "resistance-capacitance").&nbsp; The 
R-C time-constant sets a hard limit on how fast the circuit can change 
state from logic zero to logic one, which is what sets the stage for a 
spurious interrupt.<br>
  <br>
Although a careful circuit design that uses short and direct 
connections, as well as an appropriate value for the pull-up resistor, 
can minimize the R-C time-constant, it can never be reduced to zero.&nbsp; 
Therefore, your interrupt service routine must be written with the 
understanding that when an interrupt source is cleared there will be a 
delay before the microprocessor will actually "see" the transition from 
logic zero to logic one at its interrupt input.&nbsp; If logic one has not 
been attained by the time the interrupt service routine has completed 
its work and returned control to the interrupted foreground task, the 
microprocessor will start another interrupt sequence, even though no 
device is interrupting&mdash;a spurious interrupt.<br>
  <br>
In general, your interrupt service routine should poll and clear all 
interrupt sources as soon as possible after preliminary steps (for 
example, saving the 65C816's state) have been completed.&nbsp; The goal is to
 give the interrupt circuit as much time as possible to make the 
transition back to logic one before the interrupt service routine 
finishes.&nbsp; The longer your interrupt service routine waits before 
clearing interrupt sources, the greater the likelihood of a spurious 
interrupt.<br>
  <br>
In many chip designs, an interrupt status register has to be read to 
determine if the device is interrupting and if so, which event(s) caused
 the interrupt.&nbsp; Oftentimes, reading the interrupt status register will 
automatically clear the interrupt&mdash;which implies that the register value 
may have to be preserved for later processing if the device has multiple
 interrupt events (push it to the stack if necessary).&nbsp; In other cases, 
explicit action will be required to clear an interrupt, such as writing a
 mask value into a flag register.&nbsp; In either case, failing to take 
proper action can result in a device endlessly interrupting the 
microprocessor, which may eventually cause system fatality due to the 
rapid consumption of stack space.&nbsp; Be sure to carefully read the data 
sheet for each device in your system that is able to trigger an 
interrupt and understand exactly what must be done to clear the 
interrupt's cause.

<h3><a name="toc:edge_level"></a>Edge- vs. Level-Sensitive Interrupts</h3>
As earlier stated, some of the microprocessor's interrupt inputs 
are level-sensitive and others are edge-sensitive.&nbsp; It's important to be
 aware of these distinctions in your interrupt service routine, as 
seemingly random problems may otherwise occur, occasionally giving the 
impression that the system has crashed.<br>
<br>
In most 6502-family designs, multiple interrupt 
sources are connected to <tt>IRQB</tt>, which is a level-sensitive input.&nbsp; Any 
one or all devices attached to <tt>IRQB</tt> can interrupt and assuming proper 
interrupt service routine design, the microprocessor will service all 
such devices, even if one interrupts while the microprocessor is already
 executing the interrupt service routine code in response to a previous 
interrupt.<br>
  <br>
The situation is different when multiple interrupt sources are connected
 to <tt>NMIB</tt>, which is an edge-sensitive input.&nbsp; As you may recall, the 
microprocessor responds to an edge-sensitive input only when a 
transition from high to low occurs.&nbsp; Therefore, once any device has 
asserted <tt>NMIB</tt> the microprocessor will not recognize that another NMI has
 occurred until <tt>NMIB</tt> has been deasserted and then asserted once more.<br>
  <br>
For example, if two devices are connected to <tt>NMIB</tt>, one interrupts and 
gets serviced and while the NMI handler is executing, the second device 
interrupts, the microprocessor will have no way of knowing that the 
second device is requesting service.  When the NMI handler executes <tt>RTI</tt> 
and returns to the foreground task, the unserviced device will be 
ignored, as <tt>NMIB</tt> will remain low.&nbsp; If servicing that second device is 
critical to maintaining system activity (consider a jiffy timer that 
schedules tasks) and the microprocessor ignores it, the system may 
eventually <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock"><b>deadlock</b></a>.  While it is possible to accommodate such a scenario with a carefully crafted NMI 
handler (it would have to poll devices 
several times before exiting to make sure that all have been serviced), a better arrangement is to connect only one device to <tt>NMIB</tt> and completely 
avoid the problem.

<h3><a name="toc:high_speed_interrupt"></a>High Speed Interrupt Response</h3>
The 65C816 responds to hardware interrupts with alacrity.&nbsp; In fact, the 
65C816's hardware interrupt latency is much shorter than comparable 
designs, and can be reduced even more by using the somewhat-arcane <tt>WAI</tt> 
(<b>WAI</b>t for interrupt) instruction.&nbsp; Let's review something that was earlier presented about hardware interrupts:<br>
<blockquote><small>
<table bgcolor="#ccffff" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="75%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="justify" valign="middle"><small>Normally, the 65C816 doesn't "look" at its interrupt inputs until 
the currently executing instruction has been completed.&nbsp; When response 
to an interrupt does occur, the 65C816 has to save its state on the 
stack before loading the interrupt vector and proceeding.&nbsp; If the 65C816
 is operating in native mode, eight &Oslash;2 clock cycles will be consumed in 
responding to the interrupt and saving state.&nbsp; If the interrupt happens 
to occur just as the current instruction's opcode is being fetched, as 
many as eight additional &Oslash;2 cycles may elapse before interrupt 
recognition.&nbsp; Therefore, an interrupt latency of as many as 16 &Oslash;2 cycles
 is possible, depending on the instruction being executed and when 
during the instruction sequence the interrupt input is asserted.</small></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</small></blockquote>
In a general purpose computer running interactive software, hardware 
interrupt latency is important but is usually not a major issue, and is not
 alterable by ordinary means.&nbsp; However, in real-time applications, 
processing deadlines may make multiple cycle latency unacceptable.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter" target="_blank"><b>jitter</b></a> that is a byproduct of variations in 
latency that occur from one interrupt to the next may adversely affect 
the performance of a system in which a high volume of interrupts must be
 serviced within strict time limits.&nbsp; This is where the <tt>WAI</tt> instruction 
gets interesting.<br>
  <br>
Consider the following code:<br>

<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
sei&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;IRQs off</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
wai&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;wait for interrupt</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lda 
via001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;start of interrupt handler</tt><br>
  </blockquote>
The above sequence disables IRQs with <tt>SEI</tt> and then stalls the 
microprocessor with <tt>WAI</tt>.&nbsp; <tt>WAI</tt> actually stops the 65C816's internal clock
 in the &Oslash;2 high state, putting the microprocessor into a sort of 
catatonia, reducing its power consumption to micro-amperes and halting 
all processing (hardware note: executing <tt>WAI</tt> also causes the 
65C816's bi-directional <tt>RDY</tt> pin to go low&mdash;knowing that is a clue to what is 
going on inside while the 65C816 is <tt>WAI</tt>ting).&nbsp;
The system will appear to have gone completely dead.<br>
  <br>
However, as soon as any hardware interrupt other than a
 reset occurs the microprocessor will restart and exactly one &Oslash;2 cycle after the
 interrupt was received, the <tt>LDA&nbsp;VIA001</tt> instruction will be executed.&nbsp; 
In other words, interrupt latency in this scenario will always equal 
exactly one &Oslash;2 cycle&mdash;70 nanoseconds at the 65C816's maximum 
officially-rated &Oslash;2 frequency of 14 MHz.&nbsp;
Unlike the usual 
behavior when a hardware interrupt input is asserted, there is no delay 
while the current instruction finishes execution (there is no "current 
instruction" while <tt>WAI</tt>ting) and the 65C816 performs no stack operations 
upon awakening.<br>
  <br>
This method of handling interrupts obviously isn't practical in a 
general purpose computer that has to process foreground tasks along with
 interrupts&mdash;all foreground processing will cease upon execution of <tt>WAI</tt>.&nbsp; 
 It is, however, a technique that is eminently suited to any system where all processing is 
interrupt-driven, such as might be the case in a high speed data 
acquisition unit.&nbsp; This programming technique is also useful in 
specialized types of hardware, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_cardioverter-defibrillator"><b>implanted heart defibrillators</b></a>, 
in which long periods may elapse without activity and minimal power 
consumption is desired, but prompt response is required in the event of 
a "situation."<br>
  <br>
Note that the <tt>STP</tt> (<b>ST</b>o<b>P</b>) instruction could be used in place of <tt>WAI</tt>, as 
  <tt>STP</tt>'s internal effect on the microprocessor is essentially the same.&nbsp; 
However, the only interrupt input to which the microprocessor will 
respond following execution of <tt>STP</tt> is <tt>RESB</tt>, which means that 
single-cycle response isn't possible&mdash;three &Oslash;2 cycles will elapse 
following the assertion and subsequent release of <tt>RESB</tt> before the 65C816
 starts the actual reset sequence.&nbsp; Naturally, a reset will cause the 
65C816 to switch back to emulation mode and execute the code pointed to 
by the reset vector.<br>

One of the exciting possibilities with the 65C816 is that of being able 
to implement an execution environment that prevents user programs from 
affecting each other or an <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computing%29"><b>operating system kernel</b></a>.&nbsp; When the 65C816's 
interrupt capabilities are combined with stack
pointer relative addressing and suitable hardware logic, the 
development of a protected environment not unlike that of a commercial 
multiuser system can become a reality.&nbsp; While this section does not 
delve into operating system design or complex hardware logic (thick 
tomes regarding both subjects have already been written), it does 
discuss the basics of using a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_trap"><b>kernel trap</b></a> to implement an operating system <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"><b><i>application programming interface</i></b></a> or <b><i>API</i></b> on a 
65C816 system.
<br>
<br>
This section gets into more esoteric concepts than previously presented,
 so please be sure you thoroughly understand what has already been 
discussed before proceeding.
<h3><a name="toc:api_theory"></a>API Calling Theory</h3>
Found at the core of almost all computer operating systems is the 
kernel, which is at the most basic level, a body of software responsible
 for mediating access to the computer's hardware.&nbsp; The 
kernel may also be responsible for scheduling processes, maintaining 
timekeeping, gathering statistics on system usage, and other activities.&nbsp; 
Some kernel functions are strictly for internal use, for example, 
servicing jiffy IRQs, while others are intended to be utilized by user 
programs to do such things as read and write files or get data from a 
keyboard.&nbsp; The formalized means by which a user program is given access 
to such kernel functions is the system's API.&nbsp; The code that 
transfers execution from a user program to a kernel function is often 
referred to as an <b><i>API call</i></b>.
<br>
<br>
The theory behind providing a kernel API is a user program doesn't need to know how to, for example, access a disk drive or transmit a byte from the computer's serial port to a printer, as these are tasks that are handled by internal functions of the kernel.&nbsp;
The program only needs to know how to call a kernel API that will handle the desired operation.&nbsp;
In this way, the user program's design can concentrate on accomplishing the task it was intended to accomplish and avoid having to include the complex instructions needed to deal with the arcaneness of, say, interacting with a disk drive controller or driving a video display.
<br>
<br>
Over the years, various methods that implement API calls have been 
devised, the two most common being that of treating a kernel function as
 a conventional subroutine or treating a kernel function as a
specialized form of an interrupt service routine.
<br>
<br>
In the former case, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table" target="_blank"><b>static jump table</b></a> provides access to the internal 
kernel functions.&nbsp; Perhaps the best known example of a kernel jump table
 is the one present in the Commodore 64's "kernal" ROM, with which any 
Commodore eight bit assembly language programmer will be familiar.&nbsp; User
 programs access kernel functions by treating them as subroutines and 
pass parameters via the microprocessor registers.&nbsp; Each kernel function 
has a unique entry point in the jump table, which as the "static" 
adjective implies, appears at a fixed address, with entries in an 
immutable order.&nbsp; The result is that assembly language programs that use
 only the jump table to access the kernel are portable to any eight bit 
Commodore computer in which the required kernel functions are present.<br>
<br>
In the interrupt service routine method, APIs are called via a kernel 
trap, which is a machine-dependent code sequence that transfers 
execution from the user program to the kernel.&nbsp; Each API call is 
assigned an immutable index number that tells the kernel what code must 
be executed to complete the desired function.&nbsp; Along with the API index 
number, any parameters to be passed to the kernel are loaded into the 
microprocessor's registers and/or pushed to the hardware stack before 
the call.&nbsp; Any parameters returned by the API are likewise loaded in the
 registers and/or placed on the stack.&nbsp; Implied is that the 
microprocessor has a large number of general purpose registers, has 
instructions to address the stack by means other than just pushes and 
pulls, or both capabilities.<br>
<br>
Naturally, both API calling methods have their strong and weak points.&nbsp; 
Use of a jump table makes for simple user application programming and a 
generally less complicated kernel.&nbsp; Applications merely <tt>JSR</tt> to access 
the API and the kernel exits with <tt>RTS</tt>.&nbsp; The required kernel code can be very
 small and fast-executing, which was an important consideration in early
 home computers.&nbsp; However, once a system has been developed with a 
specific jump table layout, the design is essentially cast in concrete, 
even if future hardware and/or operating system revisions would be better
served with a relocated kernel and/or rearranged jump table.&nbsp;
The fact that 
applications must know where in memory the kernel is loaded and must be 
able to access that memory makes the kernel non-portable and if running 
in RAM instead of ROM, vulnerable to corrupting wild writes caused by 
program errors and/or malicious coding.<br>
<br>
Calling APIs via a kernel trap offers the advantages of portability and 
isolation.&nbsp; User programs don't need to know specific addresses to 
access the kernel API&mdash;applications only need to know API index numbers.&nbsp;
 If a new kernel is released with a new API-accessible function, the 
lowest unused API index number is assigned to the new function, which 
will not affect any applications that were written prior to the kernel 
update.&nbsp; As a user-accessible jump table is not used for calling APIs, 
the kernel can be loaded anywhere in memory that is convenient.<br>
<br>
Isolation offers the kernel some protection from misbehaving user 
applications, reducing the likelihood of random instructions or wild 
address pointers accidentally accessing and/or overwriting kernel space 
and causing system fatality.&nbsp; In most systems, a kernel trap causes a 
hardware context switch that may be used to modify the memory map, alter memory 
protection rules, and/or change instruction execution privileges, all of
 which can be used to tightly control what user programs can and cannot 
do.<br>
<br>
The principal downsides to a kernel trap API calling method are greater 
code complexity, heavy stack usage and slower execution.&nbsp; As will be 
seen, a kernel trap API ultimately involves a software interrupt to 
switch execution from user mode to kernel mode.&nbsp; Therefore, code in both
 the API "front end" and "back end" is essentially a specialized form of
 an interrupt service routine, which adds complexity to the kernel.&nbsp; 
Also, since the API entry point is the same for all APIs, dispatch code is 
required to select the specific function that must be executed for a 
particular API, as well as determine how many parameters are expected by the API.&nbsp; 
That an API call culminates in an interrupt means that slower execution will occur due to hardware and software-induced latency.
<br>
<br>
Downsides notwithstanding, the flexibility and extensibility of a kernel
 trap API are features that are hard to ignore.&nbsp; Virtually all modern operating
 systems use this method to offer services to user programs.
<h3><a name="Kernel_Trap_API_Mechanics"></a><a name="toc:kertrap_mechanics"></a>Kernel Trap API Mechanics</h3>
Most API calls require that at least one parameter be passed to 
the 
kernel.&nbsp; The number and types of parameters that must be passed to
an API will necessarily be dependent on what information is needed to 
implement the desired function.&nbsp; Use of the stack for parameter
 passing is common, primarily because the number of available general 
purpose registers may not be sufficient to handle all parameters in all 
cases.&nbsp; Therefore, prior to making an API call that requires 
parameters 
the calling function may have to generate a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_frame#Structure"><b>stack frame</b></a>.<br>
  <br>
The term <b><i>stack frame</i></b> refers to a group of related parameters that are 
pushed to the stack in a defined order prior to the execution of a 
function.&nbsp; As the sequence of pushes and the sizes of the parameters are
 defined by the function being called, individual parameters are readily
 "cherry-picked" from the stack as needed to carry out the desired 
operation.&nbsp; The function may also modify one or more of the parameters 
to return data back to the calling function.&nbsp; The calling function 
could, in turn, modify the stack frame that was generated by its caller,
 and so forth, thus passing results back "up the line."&nbsp; Understanding 
the concept of a stack frame is essential and will be expanded upon as 
discussion proceeds.<br>
  <br>
Turning to the mechanics of making a kernel trap API call, examining the
 assembly language code generated and linked by a language compiler sheds some 
light on how a stack frame and a kernel trap are used to invoke a kernel
 function.&nbsp; The way in which it is done with a Motorola 68000 
microprocessor is a good example to follow in this regard, as that 
processor has some lineage to its eight bit counterpart (the MC6800) and
 thus indirectly to the 6502 family.&nbsp; As some of the first systems to make 
widespread use of the MC68000 ran the UNIX operating environment, a 
quick look at how a UNIX kernel API call would be coded in MC68000 
assembly language can be instructive.<br>
  <br>
In the UNIX environment, where ANSI C is the predominant development 
language, the compiler outputs an intermediate assembly language 
program, and a linker generates the executable binary file containing 
the appropriate machine instructions that will perform the desired task.
&nbsp; In sections of the binary where an API call is to be made, 
system-specific code in a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library"><b>standard library</b></a> will be linked into and become 
part of the finished program.&nbsp; Generally speaking, standard library 
functions are assembly language subroutines that contain the
instructions required to cause the kernel trap to occur.<br>
  <br>
Here's an 
example of how this would work on an MC68000-powered UNIX system, using a
 brief C program that creates and opens a file named <tt>/usr/bdd/newfile</tt> 
with <tt>rw-rw-r--</tt> permissions:
<blockquote><tt>/* create &amp; open a new file in ANSI C */</tt><br>
  <br>
  <tt>char fname[] = "/usr/bdd/newfile"; /* pathname */</tt><br>
  <br>
  <tt>int main() {</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int 
fd;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 /* file descriptor */</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fd = creat(fname,0664);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* create &amp; open file */</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
return(fd);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 /* return file descriptor to caller */</tt><br>
  <tt>}</tt>
  </blockquote>
<tt>creat()</tt> is a function in the standard C library that is a machine 
language interface to a UNIX kernel API, also named <tt>creat</tt>, that creates 
and opens a new file.&nbsp; The <tt>creat</tt> kernel API call requires that two 
parameters be passed to it: a pointer to the file's pathname, which is the variable <tt>fname</tt> in 
the C source code, and a file permissions mode value, which is the literal <tt>0664</tt> 
octal number.&nbsp; The <tt>creat()</tt> library code passes 
these values and an API index number to the kernel on behalf of
 the user program.&nbsp; If the <tt>creat</tt> API call is successful, a small 
positive integer value called a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor"><b>file descriptor</b></a> will be 
returned in the variable <tt>fd</tt>.&nbsp; Alternatively, <tt>fd</tt> will return <tt>-1</tt> if <tt>creat</tt> 
fails for any reason.&nbsp; A separate variable called <tt>errno</tt> would be 
conditioned to describe the nature of the failure (error-handling code 
will be omitted for clarity).<br>
  <br>
Here's the MC68000 assembly language that the C compiler might generate 
for the above program on a UNIX machine running the System V kernel:<br>

<blockquote><tt>* machine code generated in main()...</tt><br>
  <tt>*</tt><br>

  <tt>*</tt><br>
  <tt>_error_&nbsp; </tt>...handle error processing...<br>
</blockquote>
As in 6502 assembly language, <tt>$</tt> indicates a hexadecimal value and <tt>#</tt> 
means the operand is the data (immediate mode addressing).&nbsp; Comments are
 started with <tt>*</tt>.<br>
  <br>
The switch from user mode to kernel mode occurs in the <tt>creat()</tt> library subroutine, where 
register <tt>D0</tt>, one of the MC68000's general purpose registers, is loaded 
with the eight bit API index number for the <tt>creat</tt> API call.&nbsp; Next, a 
  <tt>TRAP</tt> instruction causes execution to be transferred to the kernel.<br>
  <br>
However, before the library subroutine is called, <tt>main()</tt> generates a 
stack frame with two parameters: the pathname pointer, <tt>$41D7</tt> (the 
pointer is a made-up value), and the new file's permissions mode value <tt>$01B4</tt>, equal to 
the octal constant <tt>0664</tt> in the C source code.&nbsp; In both instructions, <tt>SP</tt> refers to 
the user stack pointer.&nbsp; Within the <tt>creat</tt> part of the kernel, code will 
read the user stack parameters and act upon them in various ways, the 
details of which the user program need not know.&nbsp; Immediately prior to 
exit, the kernel will load the file descriptor into register <tt>D0</tt> if the call was 
successful, that is, if the file was created and opened, and clear the carry
 bit in the MC68000's condition code register (<tt>CCR</tt>) to indicate that the file was created and opened.&nbsp; If carry were set in the <tt>CCR</tt> it would mean that <tt>D0</tt> contains an error code instead of a file 
descriptor.&nbsp; As an aside, in the UNIX environment it is the caller, 
  <tt>main()</tt> in this case, that has to clean up the stack following a function or API call.
<br>
<br>
In the MC68000, executing <tt>TRAP</tt> causes a software interrupt and a
 hardware context change from user mode to supervisor (kernel) mode, 
the latter action having important implications in a multitasking environment like 
UNIX.&nbsp; The context change aspect of <tt>TRAP</tt> will be ignored 
here, as the 
65C816 hardware has no such behavior.&nbsp; However, it is worth noting
 that 
in other respects, the MC68000's software interrupt behavior is very 
similar to that of the 65C816.&nbsp; In both microprocessors, an 
internal interrupt-like sequence will occur.&nbsp; Also, the MC68000 
will jump 
through a defined vector when <tt>TRAP</tt> is executed, just as the 65C816 will 
jump through a defined vector when it executes <tt>BRK</tt> or <tt>COP</tt>. <br>
<h3><a name="toc:6502_kertrap"></a>6502 Software Interrupt API</h3>
Implementing a kernel trap API on 6502 or 65C02 hardware will unavoidably 
involve the use of the <tt>BRK</tt> instruction, as it is the lone software 
interrupt in the instruction set.&nbsp; Due to the use of <tt>BRK</tt>, as well as 
general microprocessor limitations, three significant programming 
problems must be considered:
<ol>
  <li>The same hardware vector (<tt>$FFFE</tt>-<tt>$FFFF</tt>) is used by <tt>BRK</tt> and <tt>IRQ</tt>, which
 means one interrupt type must be distinguished from the other in 
software.&nbsp; This unavoidable step increases execution time and usually 
"clobbers" two registers (<tt>.A</tt> and <tt>.X</tt>).<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  <li>The 6502's registers can only handle eight bit values, which 
substantially complicates the passing of more than one 16 bit value to 
the API, a common procedure required with many I/O operations.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  <li>There are no 6502 instructions that facilitate the use of the stack 
for parameter passing or temporary indexed storage.&nbsp; As stack frame elements 
cannot be directly addressed by using the stack pointer as the relative 
index, considerable code may be required to implement indexed storage 
and retrieval.</li>
</ol>
The 65C816's enhanced stack addressing capabilities, 16 bit registers 
and separately vectored software interrupts when operating in native 
mode completely circumvent all of the above problems.&nbsp; Consequently, 
implementing a kernel trap API with the 65C816 is possible with 
relatively succinct code.<br>
  <br>
Unlike the MC68000 and other microprocessors that usually support preemptive multitasking 
environments, the 65C816 has no wired-in means of differentiating 
between "user mode" and "kernel mode" when interrupted and thus in 
itself cannot support any kind of protected environment.&nbsp; However, the 
65C816 does provide an output signal (<tt>VPB</tt>) that could be harnessed 
in conjunction with complex logic to simulate user and kernel modes.&nbsp;
How to go about doing so is well outside the scope of this article, but 
should be food for future thought.<br>
<h3><a name="toc:65c816_kertrap_api"></a>65C816 Kernel Trap API Call Model</h3>
Although the MC68000 is a more sophisticated 
microprocessor than the 65C816 and has a more complex behavior when 
executing a software interrupt instruction, an analog to the earlier 
UNIX API call procedure can be modeled in 65C816 assembly language 
without much difficulty.&nbsp; In fact, the principles are virtually identical; only 
the methodology and machine instructions differ.&nbsp; In all of the 
following code, it will be assumed that the 65C816's stack pointer has been 
initialized to <b><tt>$CFFF</tt></b> prior to any calls being made.&nbsp; If an instruction 
affects the stack pointer the new <tt>SP</tt> value following the execution of 
that instruction will be noted in <b><font color="#cc0000">boldface red</font></b>.<br>
  <br>
Here is the 65C816 analog of the above API code:<br>

<blockquote><tt>;machine code generated in main()...</tt><br>

  </blockquote>
The <tt>PEA</tt> instruction, which incidentally also exists in similar form in the MC68000, 
pushes its 16 bit operand to the stack.&nbsp; Despite the mnemonic's 
purported meaning, the operand can be anything that is known at assembly
 time, or could be altered at run time via self-modifying code.&nbsp; In this
 example, both the pathname pointer (address) and file mode have been statically 
assembled into the program and pushed, mode first and then the pathname 
address, the same order as shown in the MC68000 API call.&nbsp; The same 
procedure could be achieved by loading a 16 bit register and pushing 
it&mdash;the choice is implementation-dependent.&nbsp; Ultimately, all that has to 
be accomplished is placing parameters of the correct size on the stack 
in the correct order.<br>
  <br>
The 65C816's <tt>COP</tt> instruction stands in for the MC68000's <tt>TRAP</tt> 
instruction, with the eight bit API index number loaded into <tt>.A</tt>.&nbsp; The 
rationale behind using <tt>COP</tt> instead of <tt>BRK</tt> is that the latter instruction
 is traditionally associated with setting debugging breakpoints in 
programs, and in our opinion, its use should be limited to that purpose.&nbsp; 
On the other hand, <tt>COP</tt> is intended to be used to change operating 
context in some undetermined way (recall that the instruction means 
  <tt><b>COP</b></tt>rocessor), so its use as a kernel trap instruction is more 
appropriate.&nbsp; Also, although our focus is on native mode operation, the 
65C816 has a unique vector for <tt>COP</tt> even when operating in emulation 
mode.<br>
  <br>
While it is possible to use <tt>COP</tt>'s signature byte as the API index, doing so isn't a straightforward process, and in our opinion, there is no good reason for the effort.&nbsp;
Utilizing the stack for parameter passing leaves the registers unencumbered, therefore loading the API index into <tt>.A</tt> is quick and efficient.&nbsp;
If the signature were to be used as the API index, additional code would have to compute its location in RAM and fetch it.&nbsp;
More significantly, complications would arise unless the bank in <tt>DB</tt> was the bank in which the user program that called the API is running.&nbsp; Bits 16-23 of
 the 24 bit address that will be propagated to the hardware when the 
65C816 loads the signature will be determined by what is in <tt>DB</tt>, not what
 was in <tt>PB</tt> before <tt>COP</tt> was executed.&nbsp; Hence the 65C816 could conceivably 
load a garbage byte, not the signature.&nbsp; Circumventing this possibility would require that the value of <tt>PB</tt> that was pushed
 when <tt>COP</tt> was executed be copied from the stack and temporarily loaded into <tt>DB</tt>
 to assure that the correct bank is being accessed.&nbsp; Following the 
signature byte retrieval, <tt>DB</tt> would have to be restored so that parameter
 fetching would be from the correct location.&nbsp; That is a 
lot of hoop-jumping just to get one byte from RAM.<br>
  <br>
When the above code has executed the resulting "stack picture" following
 the <tt>COP</tt> software interrupt will be:<br>

<blockquote>Note that the register and library stack frame definitions include 
an assembly-time value (<tt>s_regsf</tt> and <tt>s_libsf</tt>, respectively) that defines 
the size of each frame in bytes, which is practical because these sizes 
are fixed.&nbsp; The size of the user stack frame will vary according to the 
API being called.<br>
    <br>
Creating definitions in this fashion makes it easier to symbolically
 reference any stack frame element without having to know the specific 
offset, thus eliminating a potential source of program errors.&nbsp; Also, 
these definitions simplify the process of realigning the stack when the 
API returns to the caller, as will soon become evident.<br>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Prior to use, the API index number is masked to prevent the content 
of <tt>.B</tt> from affecting the following instructions.&nbsp; After masking, the 
index is tested for range (API index <tt>$00</tt> is usually deemed to be illegal
 for a user API call) and if the range is acceptable, the index is 
doubled to create the <tt>apidptab</tt> dispatch jump table offset.&nbsp; This API 
dispatch method supports a maximum of 255 callable API functions&mdash;more could be supported by passing a 16 bit index.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  <li>Another look-up table, <tt>sparmtab</tt>, is consulted to find out how many 
user stack frame bytes are expected by each API function.  The use of 
this table is not demonstrated in the above code but will be 
demonstrated in the next series of code fragments.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="toc:post_api"></a>Post-API Processing</h3>
After the API code has completed its task and has placed return 
values 
on the stack, processing can be switched back to user mode.&nbsp; Prior
 to 
doing so, arrangements must be made to take care of stack 
housekeeping.&nbsp;
Otherwise, the stack will be out of balance and when <tt>RTI</tt> executes to return control to the <tt>creat()</tt> library code, the 65C816 will pull an incorrect address from the stack, surely resulting in a major malfunction.
<br>
<br>
Stack housekeeping consists of three steps:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Disposing of temporary workspace that was created within the called API function; handled within the function, since only it would "know" how much workspace was used.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  <li>Disposing of the register stack frame; handled within the API back end code.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  <li>Disposing of the user stack frame; handled by the user function that called the API or handled within the API back end code.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Stack cleanup is a relatively painless process with the 
65C816.&nbsp; In this subsection, we will demonstrate how to perform stack
cleanup in the kernel API back end code, clearing the user stack frame 
as well as the register stack frame.&nbsp; We are not advocating that 
user stack frame disposal occur within the kernel&mdash;use what is best for your application.<br>
<br>
In general, the stack housekeeping process is one of shifting the register 
and library stack frames up the stack by the total number of bytes in 
the user stack frame, and then adjusting the stack pointer so it points 
at the location immediately below the relocated register stack frame.&nbsp; 
With that done, pulling the 16 bit registers will dispose of most of the register stack frame, hence incrementing the stack 
pointer until it is pointing one byte below the stack copy of the status
 register.&nbsp; Upon execution of <tt>RTI</tt> at the end of the procedure the 65C816 
will pull <tt>SR</tt>, <tt>PC</tt> and <tt>PB</tt> in that order, disposing of the remainder of the register stack frame, exiting the kernel and resuming 
execution at the <tt>bcs _error_</tt> instruction in the <tt>creat()</tt> library code.&nbsp; 
When the <tt>creat()</tt> library code finally executes <tt>RTS</tt> to return to the 
calling function, <tt>SP</tt> will again be <tt>$CFFF</tt>, which is where it started before <tt>main()</tt> called <tt>creat()</tt>.<br>
  <br>
The most convenient way to shift stack frames is by using one of the 
65C816's block copy instructions.&nbsp; As the stack grows toward lower 
addresses, the shift is upward in memory and some overlap is likely to 
occur, which means use of the <tt>MVP</tt> instruction is the correct choice for this 
procedure.&nbsp; In the following code, 16 bit operations are used throughout
 and a sneaky little trick will be used to set the stack pointer to the 
correct location following the register and library stack frames shift.&nbsp; 
 To assist you in understanding what is going on, the code will be 
interspersed with explanatory text:<br>

<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </blockquote>
<blockquote>Following the above steps, <tt>.C</tt> contains <tt>$CFFB</tt>, since the register 
stack frame occupies ten bytes and the library stack frame occupies two.&nbsp;
   <tt>$00CFFB</tt> is the absolute address where the library <tt>RTS</tt> address MSB was
 stored when it was pushed by the <tt>jsr creat</tt> instruction in <tt>main()</tt>.&nbsp; It 
is necessary to compute this address because the <tt>MVP</tt> instruction works 
"backwards" to lower memory.&nbsp; Therefore, <tt>MVP</tt> has to start at the highest
 address from which bytes are to be copied, which would be that of the 
library <tt>RTS</tt> address MSB.&nbsp; As the <tt>MVP</tt> instruction treats the value in <tt>.X</tt> 
as the copy source address, <tt>.C</tt> is transferred to <tt>.X</tt>.<br>

<blockquote>Now, <tt>.C</tt> contains <tt>$CFFF</tt>, since the user stack frame occupied four

look-up table.&nbsp; <tt>$00CFFF</tt> will be the absolute address of the library <tt>RTS</tt> 
address MSB after the register and library stack frames have been 
shifted, and is currently the address that is occupied by the MSB of the
 file creation mode parameter that was pushed by the calling function.&nbsp; 
As the <tt>MVP</tt> instruction treats the value in <tt>.Y</tt> as the copy destination 
address, <tt>.C</tt> is transferred to <tt>.Y</tt>.&nbsp; Again, keep in mind that <tt>MVP</tt> copies 
in reverse.<br>
  <br>
  Continuing:<br>
  </blockquote>

  </blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>MVP</tt> uses <tt>.C</tt> as a down-counter to keep track of the number of bytes 
copied.&nbsp; Copying stops when <tt>.C</tt> has been decremented below zero.&nbsp; 
Therefore, the count that must loaded into <tt>.C</tt> is the size of the 
register stack frame plus the size of the library stack frame <b><i>minus one</i></b>.&nbsp;
  Also, copying must occur in bank <tt>$00</tt> because that is where all stack 
references are directed.&nbsp; Hence zero is hard-coded for the two <tt>MVP</tt> 
operands.<br>
  <br>
  When MVP has finished, the registers will be as follows:<br>
  
  <blockquote>
      <table bgcolor="#ccffff" border="3" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

  You may well be wondering how the stack index for <tt>.Y</tt> ended up being 
    <tt>$05</tt>&mdash;it previously was <tt>$01</tt>.&nbsp; The register and library stack frames were 
shifted upward by the size of the user stack frame, which was <tt>$04</tt> bytes.&nbsp;
  However, <tt>SP</tt> was not disturbed by any preceding instructions and thus 
is still <tt>$CFEF</tt>.&nbsp; Therefore, <tt>$01+$04=$05</tt> and <tt>$CFF4-$05=$CFEF</tt>.<br>
  <br>
  With the stack frame shifting out of the way, all that's left in the
 housekeeping process is to adjust <tt>SP</tt>.&nbsp; Recall above where we said "...a
 sneaky little trick is used..."?&nbsp; Take a good look at the ending values
 in the registers after <tt>MVP</tt> finished, think about what was going on 
inside the microprocessor as it was copying (read page 40 of the data 
sheet if you're not familiar with how <tt>MVP</tt> works) and then see if you can
 figure out why the next two instructions correctly set <tt>SP</tt> (no fair 
peeking at the following explanation):

<blockquote>It may not be immediately obvious why this even works.&nbsp; After all, 
no one ever uses <tt>.Y</tt> to set a stack pointer, right?&nbsp; Well, here is an 
exception!<br>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Consider that as <tt>MVP</tt> executes the microprocessor repeatedly copies a
 byte and then decrements all three registers.&nbsp; Hence when <tt>MVP</tt> has 
finished, <tt>.C</tt> will be $FFFF, <tt>.X</tt> will be pointing to a location one byte 
below the address where the 65C816 got the final byte and <tt>.Y</tt> will be 
pointing to a location one byte below the address where the 65C816 put 
that final byte.&nbsp; As the register and library stack frames have been 
relocated higher on the stack by the number of bytes in the user stack frame, the final address in <tt>.Y</tt> is now the first 
unused location on the stack, <b><i>which is by definition the address to 
which the stack pointer points</i></b>.&nbsp; So, adjusting the stack pointer merely 
involves copying whatever is in <tt>.Y</tt> to <tt>SP</tt>!<br>
    <br>
The final steps are to restore the registers and then exit to the 
    <tt>creat()</tt> library code:<br>

As <tt>RTI</tt> causes the microprocessor to pull <tt>SR</tt> from the stack, any changes 
that were made to the stack copy of <tt>SR</tt>, such as setting the carry bit to
 flag an error, will immediately take effect and the <tt>creat()</tt> library 
code can act upon them.&nbsp; Similarly, if the stack copies of any of the 
registers were altered, those changes will be propagated back to the 
  <tt>creat()</tt> library code as well.
<h3><a name="toc:access_sf_elements"></a>Accessing Stack Frame Elements</h3>
Nothing in this subsection has anything to do with interrupt processing <i>per se</i>.&nbsp;
However, everything that has preceded has made frequent reference to the stack.&nbsp;
So in the spirit of expanding your knowledge about the 65C816, consider this to be a bonus section.
<br>
<br>
As the API handler code executes it will need to be able to access both 
the register and user stack frame elements, the former to write values 
that will be returned to the caller, and the latter to read the 
parameters that were pushed by the user application.&nbsp; The 65C816's stack
 addressing instructions greatly simplify the process, as they index 
relative to the current stack pointer, eliminating the need for tedious 
address calculations.<br>
  <br>
First, a recapitulation of the stack frame definitions:
<blockquote><tt>;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; register stack frame...</tt><br>
<tt>;</tt><br>
<tt>reg_y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
=1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<tt>;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library stack frame...</tt><br>

<tt>pnptr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =fmode+2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;pathname pointer</tt><br>
</blockquote>
Using the above definitions, here are some examples of how to read and 
write stack frame elements.<br>
  <br>
First, read the file creation mode from the user stack frame:<br>

<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rep #%00100000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;16 bit accumulator</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lda 
fmode,s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;get
 mode</tt><br>
  </blockquote>
Note the use of the <tt>fmode</tt> stack frame definition and <tt>,S</tt> (stack pointer 
relative) addressing.&nbsp; Assuming that <tt>SP</tt> hasn't changed since the API 
entry point, the <tt>fmode,S</tt> operand is interpreted by the microprocessor to
 mean <tt>$CFEF+$0F</tt> or <tt>$CFFE</tt>, since <tt>fmode=$0F</tt> and <tt>SP=$CFEF</tt>.&nbsp; Therefore, the 
instruction is effectively <tt>LDA $CFFE</tt>.<br>
  <br>
Next, copy the pathname to a buffer.  The pathname is a character string
 of arbitrary length that has been terminated by a null byte (<tt>$00</tt>):<br>

<blockquote><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 sep #%00100000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;select 8 bit

Here, use is made of stack pointer relative indirect addressing to copy 
the pathname from user space to the work buffer.&nbsp; Again, the <tt>pnptr,S</tt> 
operand is translated by the microprocessor at run-time to <tt>$CFEF+$0D</tt>, 
effectively making the instruction <tt>LDA ($CFFC),Y</tt>, although such an 
addressing mode doesn't exist in reality.&nbsp; Note that a check is made for
 an excessively long pathname, the maximum permissible length being 
defined by <tt>PATH_MAX</tt>.&nbsp; Labels such as <tt>.0000010</tt> and <tt>.0000020</tt> are local 
labels&mdash;use whatever syntax is implemented in your assembler.<br>

Return the open file descriptor to the calling function via the eight 
bit accumulator by overwriting the appropriate register stack frame 
element:<br>

<blockquote>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

accumulator</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lda 
#0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ;clear...</tt><br>
  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
xba&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lda

 file descriptor, ...</tt><br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

reg_a,s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
;overwrite .C's stack copy</tt><br>

When the accumulator is pulled it will contain the value that was in 
  <tt>filedes</tt>.<br>
