<hr>        

<p>A number of good articles have been published on providing Forth interrupt response.  Without invalidating the work of
others, I wanted to meet the challenge of accomplishing high-level Forth interrupt response in a much simpler way that
would still work in most typical indirect-threaded systems not using preemptive multitasking.</p>

<p>I was told by several people that it couldn't be done, which of course only fueled my fire.  The result I've been using
for thirteen years now is described here.  I wanted it in 1990 for the production automated test equipment (ATE) I
designed and programmed, which you can see <a href="http://www.6502.org/users/garth/projects.php?project=6">here</a>.  The RS-232 input from
the PC for software development was handled at 9600 bps through a 65C51 ACIA entirely by interrupts in high-level Forth
on a 2MHz 65C02.</p>

<p>One man told me that he always does interrupts in assembly for speed, so he wasn't very interested in high-level Forth
interrupt service.  The nice thing here is that when you eliminate the overhead, you get some of the speed back.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this short article to provide all the details, but rather the concept and what makes it
possible.</p>

<p>The zero-overhead interrupt support is very simple, adds only about 100 bytes to your overall code, and can be nested--
ie, you can allow a higher-priority interrupt to interrupt the servicing of a lower-priority one-- as many interrupt
levels deep as you wish.  No additional stacks are required.  It's another natural for Forth.  As usual for interrupts,
some assembly is required, but very little.</p>

<p>I call it "zero-overhead" interrupt response because when an interrupt occurs, the Forth system moves right into the
interrupt-service routine (ISR) just as if it were part of the normal code.  Here's the summary:  it is as if a new
word was suddenly inserted into the executing code-- a word whose stack effect is ( -- ).</p>

<p>To illustrate, suppose we had an interrupt service routine (word) which, for the sake of simplicity, only consisted of:</p>
<pre>
: ISR  ( -- )  1 COUNTER +!  SYSRTI  ;
</pre>

<p>and Forth was executing the 2 in the line,</p>

<pre>
PRINTER  2 SPACES  BOLD_ON
</pre>

<p>when an interrupt was requested.  Although slightly faster-- yes, <i>faster!</i>-- the effect would otherwise be the same as
if there were no interrupts and the line had said,</p>

<pre>
PRINTER  2  INC_COUNTER  SPACES  BOLD_ON
</pre>

<p>where <code>INC_COUNTER</code> had been defined as</p>

<pre>
: INC_COUNTER  ( -- )  1 COUNTER +!  ;
</pre>

<p>like ISR above.  As you can see, the main program and the interrupt can both execute without interfering with each
other, even though they both use the same stacks and other basic resources.</p>

<p>So how is it done?  The coordination that avoids the overhead requirement is done in <code>NEXT</code>, indirect-threaded Forth's
inner loop.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to save anything before executing the ISR or restore anything afterward.  The only exception is
that the <code>SYSRTI</code> above is like an ordinary <code>unnest</code> (or <code>EXIT</code> , <code>SEMIS</code> , <code>;S</code> , etc., whatever it is called in your system)
except that it also restores the ability to accept interrupts if appropriate.  You may even decide to omit the <code>SYSRTI</code> .
If you do use the <code>SYSRTI</code> , the semicolon after it has no effect at run time.</p>

<p>Since servicing the interrupt does not require saving things, the interrupt service routine does not need any more
stack space than other Forth words.  Assuming we already had enough stack space to run Forth normally (we actually have
plenty on the 6502), we shouldn't need to worry about running out just because of the interrupts.</p>

<p>The possible disadvantage with this method is that a primitive (i.e., code definition) cannot be interrupted.  Whatever is requesting service
must wait until the current primitive is finished.  This would only be a problem <i>if</i> you have primitives that take a
long time to execute, and <i>if</i> those primitives are used at the times interrupt service is requested, and <i>if</i> the
interrupt can't wait that long.</p>

<p>Otherwise, consider that it will typically take many primitives to service the interrupt, and it would be an
insignificant delay to wait for one primitive in the main program to finish executing.  It typically takes far less
time to finish the currently executing primitive than to do all the register-saving and other setups required by other
methods of high-level-language interrupt service.</p>

<p>The only return-from-interrupt overhead that is almost necessary with this method is that of re-enabling interrupts.
If you don't need this done on a return from interrupt, the interrupt service routine can be a normal colon definition
(or secondary), ending with the standard <code>unnest</code> compiled by ; (semicolon), and there will be absolutely zero overhead
for return from interrupt too.</p>

<p>Here comes the assembly.  We have to make some small changes in <code>NEXT</code>, indirect-threaded Forth's inner loop, that
basically amount to polling.  These changes slow down the Forth execution by about one-thirtieth; however the absence
of a big overhead penalty means that you'll get far more than this one-thirtieth back if interrupts come often.</p>

<p>In the Forth-83 system where I have implemented this on a 65C02, a couple of machine-language instructions added to <code>NEXT</code>
load a byte from memory while simultaneously examining it to see whether it is zero or not.  A branch is taken if
appropriate.  The choices are either to continue on as usual in <code>NEXT</code>, or to load the word pointer <code>W</code> with the interrupt
vector instead of with the contents of the address pointed to by the instruction pointer <code>IP</code>.</p>

<p>Some of the time taken by the extra pair of machine-language instructions is saved by the fact that we only allow two
values for the byte which is fetched to see if interrupt service is necessary.  These are values we would have to load
into the processor's <code>Y</code> register anyway, even if we could somehow execute the right part of <code>NEXT</code> without testing.</p>

<p>If there is an interrupt to service, the new part of <code>NEXT</code> also turns off the bit in memory which records that there is
interrupt service due.  This takes less time than incrementing the instruction pointer; and loading the interrupt
vector into the word pointer <code>W</code> requires no indirect addressing.  This means that the <code>nest</code> (or <code>DOCOL</code> , etc.) instruction
in the interrupt handler actually gets executed <i>sooner</i> than the next instruction in the main code would have been
executed had there been no interrupt!</p>

<p>My original version of <code>NEXT</code> (before interrupt service implementation) was right out of the public-domain FIG-Forth 6502
assembly source, like Listing One-A.</p>

</pre>

<p>After the modification, <code>NEXT</code> looks like the code in Listing One-B.  Notice how much shorter the code is for responding
to an interrupt than for continuing on with the next instruction in the main Forth code!  This makes the relative
interrupt response time very short.  We no longer have to increment the instruction pointer when going to the
interrupt-handling word.  If we did, the latter would be <i>replacing</i> the next Forth instruction in the main code
instead of <i>delaying</i> it.</p>

<p>You will need a piece of machine code at the address pointed to by the machine-recognized interrupt vector location.
If interrupts are enabled, this piece of code will be executed like any other short machine-language ISR as soon as the
hardware interrupt-request line goes true and the currently executing machine-language instruction finishes.  This code
only needs to put a byte in memory which can later be tested by <code>NEXT</code>, and disable the machine interrupt response so
that the same code doesn't get executed over and over.  Mine looks like Listing Two.<p>

<p><i>Listing Two:  This registers the interrupt request for <code>NEXT</code>.</i></p>
<pre>
irqrouting:          ; Machine-recognized interrupt vector at FFFE points here.  
     JMP  (MIRQVEC)  ; Jump to address pointed to by the machine-language        
                     ; interrupt vector MIRQVEC , which is initially setirq.     
                                                                                 
setirq:              ; Use to record IRQ for NEXT.  Put this address in MIRQVEC. 
     STZ  irqnot     ; Record that interrupt was req'ed by storing 0 in irqnot.  
     STA  tempA      ; Temporarily save accumulator in tempA to restore below.   
        PLA          ; Pull saved processor status byte off the &mu;P stack,        
        ORA  #4      ; set the bit corresponding to the interrupt disable,       
        PHA          ; and push the revised status byte back on the stack.       
     LDA  tempA      ; Restore the accumulator content.                          
     RTI             ; Return from interrupt.  &mu;P status gets restored modified. 
</pre>

<p>Next, you will need Forth primitives that enable and disable interrupting.  I call them <code>IRQOK</code> and <code>NOIRQ</code> .  Another
primitive, <code>IRQOK?</code> , returns my interrupt-disable flag.  See Listing Three.</p>

<p><i>Listing Three:   Interrupt-disable flag support words</i></p>
<pre>
CODE IRQOK  ( -- )  ; Compile header for IRQOK .  Since it's 
       CLI          ; a primitive, the CFA points here to CLI
       JMP NEXT     ; instruction.  All done now so jump out.
                                                             
CODE NOIRQ  ( -- )  ; Compile the header for NOIRQ .   The   
       SEI          ; only instruction is SEI, then you go   
       JMP NEXT     : back to NEXT for the next Forth word.  
                                                             
CODE IRQOK?   ( -- f )  ; f=0 means interrupts are disabled. 
       PHP              ; Bring processor status register    
       PLA              ; contents into accumulator.         
       AND  #4          ; Look at only the I bit.            
       BEQ  1$          ; If clear, branch to put true flag  
       JMP  PUSH-FALSE  ; on the data stack.  Else false.    
 1$:   JMP  PUSH-TRUE   ; These branch to NEXT when done.    
</pre>

<p>A byte in RAM called <code>irqok?</code> (lower case) is used as a flag to record whether or not Forth interrupts are being allowed.
<code>irqok?</code>  is checked by <code>SYSRTI</code> , my Forth return-from-interrupt word.  When a peripheral requests an interrupt, <code>setirq</code> (in
Listing Two) disables further interrupting but leaves <code>irqok?</code> alone so the interrupt permission status will be correctly
restored at the end of the ISR.</p>

<p>You will usually leave interrupts disabled while the Forth interrupt service word is executing, and re-enable them when
the interrupt service word finishes.  <code>SYSRTI</code> is nothing more than <code>unnest</code> preceded by a few machine-language
instructions to examine the content of <code>irqok?</code> and set or clear the processor's interrupt-disable bit accordingly.  If
you don't ever need to change the value of that bit immediately upon return, you can omit <code>SYSRTI</code> , and the service word
can be like any other colon definition.  (If you do use <code>SYSRTI</code> , remember to follow it with the semicolon if you haven't
made <code>SYSRTI</code> do all the compile-time jobs that ; does.)  My <code>SYSRTI</code> looks like the code in Listing Four.</p>


<p><i>Listing Four:  Forth return-from-interrupt</i></p>
<pre>
CODE SYSRTI   ( -- )   ; Lay header and code field down.                         
       SEI             ; Start with interrupting disabled.                       
       LDA  irqok?     ; Load & test byte at addr IRQOK? to see if IRQs are ok.  
       BEQ  unnest+2   ; If not ok, don't execute next CLI instruction.          
       CLI             ; Else clear interrupt disable flag.                      
       BRA  unnest+2   ; Branch to body of unnest (1st addr after code field).   
</pre>

<p>To allow multiple-nested interrupts, an interrupt service word must re-enable interrupts (by invoking <code>IRQOK</code> ).  If you
chose to do this, you might also want to push or otherwise save the content of <code>irqok?</code> and change it.  This is so each
return from interrupt leaves the interrupt-disable flag in the appropriate state.  Of course if the flag is put back to
the way it was just before the interrupt, it will always allow interrupts again.  This is what <code>SYSRTI</code> will give you
unless there was something in the ISR that turned off <code>irqok?</code> .  The purpose of <code>irqok?</code> is to tell <code>SYSRTI</code> whether or not
to re-enable interrupts.</p>

<p>With indirect-threaded code, the average Forth primitive takes about 80 clocks to execute on the 65C02, including time
spent in <code>NEXT</code>, the inner loop.  Since, on the average, an interrupt will hit in the middle of an executing primitive
(paired with <code>NEXT</code>), and since <code>NEXT</code> is quicker at starting interrupt service than it is at normal code, the average
interrupt latency will be about 90 clocks, or 6.4&mu;s at 14MHz.  All the 65C02's WDC is selling today are guaranteed to
be able to run at least this fast.  The 6.4&mu;s includes the time taken by the short machine-language routine pointed to
by the machine interrupt-request vector <code>MIRQVEC</code>.  Some other 8-bit processors cannot even achieve this kind of
interrupt latency in machine language; so to do it in Forth with the 65C02 is excellent!  14MHz makes for about 175,000
Forth primitives per second, but the 14MHz speed rating currently available turns out to be a conservative rating, and
actual capability is generally much higher.  Again, this is for an indirect-threaded Forth implementation, which is
probably the slowest of four or five methods but yields the most compact code, allows this simple interrupt method, and
has some other advantages in interactive code development.</p>

<p>A Forth interrupt service routine that only looks at a 65C51 ACIA might look like this:</p>
<pre>
: SYSIRQ  POLL_ACIA  DROP  SYSRTI  ;	( -- )
</pre>
<p>Since here we only have one possible source of interrupts, we can <code>DROP</code> the flag telling whether or not it was the ACIA
that requested service.</p>

<p>If we had several possible interrupt sources, our <code>SYSIRQ</code> might look like the code in Listing Five-A.  The
highest-priority interrupt sources are polled first.  Once the source of the interrupt is found and serviced, the
following polls in the ISR are skipped.  Again, each polling word called here leaves a flag on the data stack telling
whether it was able to take care of the interrupt.</p>

<p><i>Listing Five-A:  Interrupt handler that polls potential interrupt sources.</i>
<pre>
: SYSIRQ    ( -- )                                                        
   POLL_TIMER     NOT  IF

<p>Listing Five-B is an alternative that uses a support word.  <code>?EXIT</code> is just my word to factor out occurrences of
<code>IF EXIT THEN</code> .  Any prioritized polling of interrupt sources can be put or called between <code>SYSIRQ</code> and <code>SYSRTI</code> above.</p>

<p>To go a step further, the <code>?EXIT</code> could be made part of each polling word.</p>

<p>Notice that the <code>SYSRTI</code> ends the two <code>SYSIRQ</code> examples of Listing-Five A and B, so the called polling words ( <code>POLL_TIMER</code> ,
<code>POLL_ACIA</code> , etc.) themselves should just end with the normal semicolon like any other colon definition.</p>

<p>Table One gives a summary of the changes and additions used to accomplish zero-overhead high-level Forth interrupt
response.  A list of requirements is first, followed by a list of enhancements.</p>

Necessary:                                                                                                    
NEXT    (Modified, not new.)  Inner loop for indirect-threaded model                                          
irqnot  RAM byte to record whether or not an interrupt is pending.  Used by NEXT.                             
NOIRQ   Primitive to  set  &mu;P interrupt disable bit  ( -- )   Just does SEI.                                  
IRQOK   Primitive to clear &mu;P interrupt disable bit  ( -- )   Just does CLI.                                  
setirq  Machine-language interrupt routine that puts 0 in irqnot to tell NEXT that an interrupt was requested.
SYSIRQ  Colon definition for actual high-level interrupt service.  No special rules except that it usually    
        will have SYSRTI just before the semicolon.  ( -- )                                                   
RESET   (Modified, not new.)  Before the first execution of NEXT, put 1 in irqnot.                            
COLD    (Modified, not new.)  Initialize all interrupt vectors.  Initialization of hardware is done before    
        invoking IRQOK .                                                                                      
                                                                                                              
Optional:                                                                                                     
IRQOK?  Primitive to read &mu;P interrupt disable bit     ( -- f )    Flag=0 means interrupts are disabled.      
irqok?  RAM byte to record whether or not to restore interrupt capability upon return from interrupt.         
SYSRTI  Primitive ( unnest version for return from interrupt).  Examines irqok? byte     ( -- )               
MIRQVEC Variable containing an address used by the machine ISR for a jump indirect.  This allows installing   
        higher-priority machine-language ISRs ahead of the Forth interrupt operations.  (More below.)         
FIRQVEC Variable containing the Forth interrupt vector (actually a CFA).  If you have more than one high-     
        level interrupt service word, put the CFA of one of them here.  NEXT uses it to load the word         
        pointer W from in order to service the interrupt.                                                     
</pre>

<p>So far we have assumed we are servicing interrupts requested on the IRQ line.  If you want to service an interrupt on
the NMI line, or transfer the idea to another processor with more interrupt inputs, each associated vector would put
the appropriate interrupt handler address in the <code>FIRQVEC</code> variable.</p>

<p>If you have hardware that prioritizes interrupts and gives the processor a byte to read to determine the source of an
interrupt without polling, it may be appropriate to have a look-up table to convert the byte into a CFA of an interrupt
handler.<p>

<p>As mentioned in Table One, you can still install a machine-language ISR that will get priority over the Forth ISRs.
If you want to add something to the machine-language IRQ routine, your routine must meet these requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the end, your routine must leave <code>A</code>, <code>X</code>, and <code>Y</code> the way it found them.  (That's normal for ISRs.)</li>
<li>The address of your routine must be stored in <code>MIRQVEC</code> .  Don't forget to restore <code>MIRQVEC</code> if you de-activate your routine.</li>
<li>If your routine determines that the interrupt source it is responsible for was not the one that caused the interrupt,
it must jump to <code>setirq</code>, whose address was in <code>MIRQVEC</code> when you booted up.</li>
<li>If your routine did indeed take care of an interrupt, it must <i>not</i> jump to <code>setirq</code>, but rather end with <code>RTI</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable interrupts temporarily to make sure an interrupt can't hit between the time you store the low byte of <code>MIRQVEC</code>
        and when you store the high byte.  This would result in an invalid address being read, and you'd get a crash.</li>
<li>If you remove your machine-language ISR, don't set the &mu;P interrupt-disable flag if there's anything in the Forth
        ISR list that needs interrupts enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your new ISR will get run before the IRQ ISR that was resident from boot-up.  The new one takes priority.</p>

<p>The high-level Forth interrupt system I am using in my 65C02 Forth now allows up to 8 simultaneously "armed" ISRs, and
has Forth words to install, prioritize, list, and delete ISRs on the fly.  This does add a little overhead so it's no
longer "zero overhead," but still has no new stacks or separate sets of any variables etc..  The running through the
list of installed ISRs can still be preceded by a single zero-overhead Forth ISR if desired, with this single
zero-overhead Forth ISR's installation being similar to that shown above for machine-language ISRs.</p>

<p>My 65816 Forth additionally affords a list of up to 8 machine-language ISRs that can be manipulated on the fly
similarly to how the Forth ISRs are in the description above.  (I did not do this part on the 65C02 Forth because it is
not as practical since entire 16-bit addresses cannot be handled all at once with the 6502's 8-bit registers, so little
would be gained.)  The '816 Forth ISR system does allow for situations where if a problem is found by a
machine-language ISR, you can transfer execution to a Forth ISR in order to use the Forth words for displaying, etc. to
report the problem or access other system capabilities.</p>

<p>Something I did in the '816 Forth to speed up <code>NEXT</code> was to integrate <code>W</code> and <code>IP</code> as actual operands of instructions in
<code>NEXT</code>.  This eliminates a level of indirection and shortens the code.  It does however mean that <code>NEXT</code> must reside in the
direct page (which I am keeping as zero page).  This means that if the bulk of the Forth kernel is in ROM, <code>NEXT</code> must be
copied to RAM before running.  <code>NEXT</code> is only five instructions for IRQ however and seven for non-IRQ, so it takes up
very little of my zero page.  There is a way to get the non-IRQ portion down to a total of four instructions.  However
since the cycle count is not reduced and other small complications are incurred, I don't think it's worth it.  Unlike
in 6502 Forth, my '816 <code>NEXT</code> does leave the carry flag alone, which I suppose means you could use it to streamline
multiple-precision arithmetic operations.</p>

<p>Since these extras in the Forth ISR system are not specifically related to the 6502 (or even 65816), they will not be
explained here.  It is also not my purpose here to show all the variations that can be implemented on the '02 and '816,
but to convey the basic idea in a functional way.  Once that is understood, programmer ingenuity along with the
prerequisite familiarity with Forth will go a long way.  If you want to discuss it however, you can E-mail me at the
address above.</p>

<p>I do plan to post my very complete 65816 Forth source here on 6502.org and later possibly my 65C02 Forth as well, and
these will have very detailed explanation of all the innards.  These are definitely not wimpy minimalist models.  They
include things like trig, log, square root, clock, calendar, and alarm functions, hundreds of primitives (code
definitions) for good performance, extended-precision arithmetic words, an assembler, extra string functions, and extra
compiling, debugging, and developing tools.  It's modular, so you can select to include only the files you want.</p>

<p>In the '816 Forth, <code>NEXT</code> does not poll to see if interrupt service has been requested like the '02 Forth <code>NEXT</code> does.  The
common colon definitions end with <code>JMP (NEXTadr)</code> instead of <code>JMP NEXT</code>, and <code>NEXTadr</code> contains the address of the right part
of <code>NEXT</code> to run, either for beginning interrupt service or for continuing on with the code it was already executing.</p>

<p>I have not looked at whether this interrupt method would be practical with true multitasking.  For the type of work I
do, the pseudo-multitasking I can get with interrupts has been adequate.  True multitasking is not that difficult in
Forth on a 6502, but I expect that because of the stack space afforded by the 6502, both data and return stacks,
running more than three or four tasks at once would require a lot of care.  I expect the zero-overhead interrupt method
would work fine on multitasking systems as long as tasks are not switched during an ISR.  There shouldn't be any danger
of that with round-robin cooperative multitasking.</p>

<p>Hopefully it won't take too much head-scratching or meditation for all this to make sense.  It really is quite simple
as high-level interrupt service methods go; and if multiple nesting doesn't make it irresistible, the elimination of
separate stacks and other overhead certainly should.</p>
