In this article, Ruud Baltissen describes how you can make your own KIM-1 replica.  Ruud
improves on the original design and makes it much easier to construct by reducing the
parts count using some modern chips not available at the time the original KIM-1 was sold.
<P>Ruud's "KIM-2" retains full software compatibility with the original KIM-1 microcomputer.
Schematics for both the original and the simplified version are included along with
source code for the monitor ROM.  Good luck and have fun building your own classic KIM-1!

<hr><p><B><FONT COLOR="#3300FF">What is the KIM-1?</B></FONT>

<P>If you don't know by now then stop and read my document about the
<A HREF="kim.htm">KIM-1</A> first.

<p><B> <FONT COLOR="#3300FF">The Troublemaker: 6530 </FONT> </B>

<P>The only real hurdle to building a replica KIM-1 is an old I/O chip
called the 6530.  Anybody who is a little familiar with the hardware market
can tell you that you can't find anywhere to buy the old 6530 anymore,
and it is used twice in the original KIM-1.  Happily enough
there is another IC available which you could call its brother:
the 6532.

<P>The 6532 has 16 I/O-lines, an internal timer and 128 bytes of RAM onboard.
It also has no internal mask-programmed ROM. But we (should) know by now that
the internal ROM of the 6530 could be selected unindependently from the I/O.
So for this project we'll use an external EPROM as replacement. The pinout of
the 6532 is completely different but that should not be a problem. The next
difference is the fact that the 6532 has a separate IRQ and PB7 line. As we will
see, the functionality of both lines is the same as with the 6530. To create
the same circumstances we only have to connect them together.  The third difference
is the availability of PB6 with a 6532. See it as a bonus as I haven't found any
reason how it could jeopardize our project. The fourth difference is that it is
possible to generate an interrupt depending the behaviour of PA7. But this is an
option which is out of function by default after a reset.

<P>The last and major difference however lays in the way the registers are selected:

</PRE>
As we can see, the last 16 registers equal the 16 of the 6530.
So now we have to develop some logic which will do the following:

<UL><LI>The 6532 is only visible within a range of 128 bytes
<LI>The first 16 bytes represent register 16 to 31
<LI>The next 48 bytes are mirrors of the first 16
<LI>The last 64 bytes apear as RAM
</UL>
Conclusion:
<UL>
<LI>Input A6 won't be used and can be tied to GND
<LI>Input A4 is connected to addressline A4 of the 6502 via an invertor.
<LI>An 74LS138/74LS08 construction or equivalent enables the RS- and CS-lines at the right moment.
</UL>

<B> <FONT COLOR="#3300FF">ROM and RAM </FONT> </B>

<P>Here we have another problem. The original KIM-1 only has 2K of ROM.  While it is
possible to buy a 2K EPROM (the 2716), it is more expensive and much less available than
the popular 2764, an 8K device.  The same problem applies to the RAM.  We will use the 8K
parts and simply tie the upper address lines to GND to make them act like the 2K versions.

<P>On the new schematic the EPROM and SRAM are wired up to act just like the original
KIM-1 memories.  However, it would be quite simple to use the upper portions of these chips
we have disabled to expand the memory of your replica KIM-1.
You can do this by OR-wiring the CS-line with more Kx-outputs of the main
74145.  Don't forget to wire up the address lines also!
In case of the EPROM we can tie switches
to the surplus address lines and have the advantage of a switchable multi-KERNEL system.

<p><B> <FONT COLOR="#3300FF">Source Codes of the ROM </FONT> </B>

<P>You can compile your own monitor ROM based on my commented source code.  You can
<A HREF="kim-src.htm">browse it</A> online or download it as a text file:
<A HREF="kim-src.asm">kim-src.asm</A>.  It should be 100% okay.<p><B>

<FONT COLOR="#3300FF">Schematics of the New KIM-1 </FONT> </B>

<p>Available here as a GIF file: <A HREF="kim-rb.gif">kim-rb.gif</A>.  You can compare it
to my schematic of the original KIM-1: <A HREF="kim.gif">kim.gif</A>.
<p>These are major differences between the two:
<UL>
<LI>Replacement of the 6530s by 6532s.
<LI>Replacement of the 6108 RAM-ICs by one 6264 or equivalent 8K*8 SRAM.
<LI>Adding an EPROM.
<LI>Adding a 74LS138 to decode the RAM and I/O of the 6532s.
<LI>Combining K6 and K7 to one line, dropping the resistor for K6.
<LI>Adding jumpers to enable combining other K-lines as well.
</UL>
I didn't change things which are more or less obvious like replacing the clock circuit
by an oscillator module or replacing all different TTL-ICs by LS or HCT types.
