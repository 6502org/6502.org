There has been some interest in using a WDC 65C816 processor in a system that was designed for a 6502. &nbsp;
 However, the two are not pin for pin compatible. &nbsp; Some form of adapter is required. &nbsp;
 With some suggestions from the users on the 6502 Forum, I created a working schematic for an adapter. &nbsp;
 IC3 and IC4 are used to create the two-phased clock output PH1 and PH2 that the 65816 does not generate. &nbsp;
 IC2 is used to keep the data bus at high-impedance during PH1.  <p>

Here is the Schematic:<br>

Now, the hard part. &nbsp; We wanted to keep the size of our adapter as small as possible. &nbsp; By using SOIC
 versions of IC2,3,4, and the TQFP version of 65816, it became possible to squeeze the entire circuit into the
 size of a DIP40. <p>

Here is a picture of my layout:<br>

As you can see, there is not much room wasted! <p>

If you are interested in building this adapter, the ExpressPCB schematic and layout files can be downloaded here:

PLEASE NOTE: &nbsp; I have not actually built or tested this design. &nbsp; Use it at your own risk.<p>
