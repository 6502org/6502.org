<p></p><h3>Commodore IEC Serial Interface</h3>
by Richard Cini, 30 Nov 2004
<hr>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>This project is an implementation of Commodore's IEC serial bus for homebuilt 6502-based systems with a 6522 VIA.  It allows
Commodore printers and disk drives to be directly utilized by a homebuilt machine.  The hardware and software were adapted from
the Commodore VIC-20 home computer.  The project presented here should work on almost any 6502-based system. Daryl Rictor's
popular SBC-2 board was used to test the project.</p>

<h4>Interface Hardware</h4>
<p>The physical connection interface for the Commodore serial IEC bus is a 6-pin circular DIN connector 
(AMP 212045-1 (shielded), Singatron 2DJ-0196PA02, CUI SDS-60J, or equivalent). Electrically, the serial 
IEC bus is a three-wire bi-directional serial bus (clock, data, and "attention") plus system ground and 
reset signals. Each signal line is driven by the VIA through a 7406 high-current open-collector inverter/driver, 
with the output pulled-up to Vcc through 1kW resistors. 1N914 diodes on the signal lines act as voltage clamps. 
The signal then passes through ferrite beads for increased noise immunity.</p>

<p>The attached peripherals are daisy-chained together using 3-foot long 6-conductor shielded cables with a 6-pin circular 
male DIN connector (Singatron YE-1156, CUI SD-60, or equivalent) on either end.</p>

<h4>CBM-IEC BIOS and SBC-2 Integration</h4>


<h4>History of this Project</h4>
<p>This project came about through a request by Mike Naberezny as a result of two of my ongoing Commodore-related projects, 
a 6502-based EBX form factor single-board computer and the Commodore Kernal disassembly project (for the eventual use 
with my SBC). The Kernal project has been the subject of a series of articles in C=Hacking e-zine over the last few years.</p>

<p>The first computer I ever owned was a VIC-20 back in 1980. I have always liked the functionality and feature set of the 
somewhat quirky Commodore hardware. In my early computing years, I programmed these machines at the lowest level, and I 
became "one" with the hardware and firmware. When I went to college in 1985, I bought a Macintosh 512k (a "Fat Mac") and 
a few years later, an IBM PC. The VIC was shelved forever - or at least until I joined the hobby of "classic" or "vintage" 
computer collecting.</p>

<p>After Commodore finally closed its doors in 1994, I found that there was a lack of direct information on the VIC-20 Kernal. 
I thought that there might be value in having usable source code for future 6502-based SBCs that I might build. Additionally, 
Commodore peripherals are cheap, plentiful, and very functional for all sorts of homebrewed projects.</p>

<p>In 1995, I attempted to contact the trustee of Commodore's bankruptcy estate to try to purchase the source code and related 
materials, but I never heard anything from them. I'm sure my request went into a circular file somewhere inside the law firm 
of Kaye, Scholer as the assets were sold to Escom and then ultimately to Gateway after Escom's 1996 receivership. After this 
effort concluded I decided to produce a workable source module myself using nothing more than available printed information, 
a copy of the ROM from my own machine and lots of time.</p>

<p>So, over a long period of time, I painstakingly scanned a printed ROM disassembly and edited it to produce a source file that 
compiled into a working ROM. I concluded that the original Commodore programmers were highly skilled in that they squeezed all 
that they could out of the allocated 7k of ROM space for the Kernal. In the process I found only about 64 bytes of unused ROM 
space.</p>

<p>Mike contacted me towards the end of 2002 with a project that would make use of the Kernal code. As I was between projects 
(primarily my Altair32 Emulator), I jumped at the chance to make another meaningful contribution to the hobby. Mike's project 
is to use Daryl Rictor's SBC2 65C02-based single-board computer and a Commodore serial IEC disk drive as a data logger.</p>

<h4>About Porting the VIC-20's IEC Routines</h4>
<p>The serial routines on the VIC-20 are embedded in the VIC-20 Kernal ROM, and clearly there is much code in the Kernal
that isn't needed for this application. The VIC-20 Kernal source code is of course tied closely to the original hardware 
and its peculiarities, and to date had never been used on anything other than the VIC-20.  The first to go was the code that supported the screen and keyboard.  Next was the cassette tape code, but extricating this code was much 
tougher since it is interwoven with the code I needed to retain to support the IEC port (particularly in the <code>OPEN, INPUT, 
OUTPUT, LOAD,</code> and <code>SAVE</code> commands).</p>

<p>The code was then cleaned up to make it more modularized.  The original programmers relied on tricks
to minimize wasted bytes, including exiting routines through unrelated routines. It was felt that the use of a few more bytes was 
worth improving code readability and maintainability, costing no more than 32 bytes or so to accomplish this goal. Other 
modifications included reconfiguring the VIA port bits so that they were all assigned to one chip (in the VIC-20, IEC 
requirements were met by combining spare pins on its two VIAs).</p>

<p>Lastly, I had to ensure that I had space in RAM to accommodate program variable requirements. In total, the serial IEC 
code only requires about 64 bytes of RAM, but it has to share space with the native EhBASIC interpreter and a system 
monitor/assembler. With some effort, I was ultimately able to squeeze my requirements into the memory space. The Commodore DOS 
interpreter requires another 36 bytes for a grand total of about 100 bytes of RAM usage.</p>

<p>When the initial modifications were completed, the code size was reduced from the original 7k to 1.4k - an 80% reduction. 
Adding a DOS command interpreter raised the memory footprint to its current size of about 3.2k.</p>
