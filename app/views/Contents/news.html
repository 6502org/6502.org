        <p>Carsten Strotmann's instructions for porting Sweet 16 have been added to
        the Source Code Repository. Sweet 16 is a metaprocessor or "pseudo microprocessor"
        implemented in 6502 assembly language.  Originally written by Steve Wozniak and
        used in the Apple II, Sweet 16 can also be ported to other 6502-based systems to
        provide useful 16-bit functionality.  This article includes the source code for
        Sweet 16, along with a brief history, programming instructions, and notes to help
        port it.

        <p>Daniel Wallner's T65 core has been added to the Homebuilt Projects section.
        The T65 is a free 6502 VHDL core that supports the 6502, 65C02, and 65C816
        instruction sets.  A reference SoC design is also provided,
        complete with ROM, RAM, and two 16450-compatible UARTs.

        assembled, and simulated.  The author is actively developing and
        continually improving the program.  A link to it has been added
