    		  MicroChess is a very famous game written by Peter Jennings in 1976. It
          was originally written for the MOS Technology KIM-1 but is easily
          ported and was used on other systems like the Rockwell AIM-65. Daryl
          Rictor has updated the program for use on projects with a 6551-based

      		The typical RAM test consists of reading and writing $AA and $55 to each

          it does not specifically find bad address lines. This simple method does

    		The Optimal Sort is another improvement on the bubble sort but uses a different
    		approach than the Combination Sort.

    		<ul><li>
    		An expansion on the 8-bit Optimal Sort above, this version allows for
        sorting of large numbers (over 255) of 16-bit elements.

    		<ul><li>
			A radix 256 counting sort to demonstrate that other sorts can be
			significantly faster than QuickSort.  This implementation does a
			signed 16-bit integer sort of 1K of data.

  		<span style="font-size:10px;">by Fredrik Ramsberg</span>
    		<ul><li>
    		The Shell Sort is a highly-efficient sorting algorithm. This
        implementation can sort a large number (>32,000) of 16-bit elements.
        Sorting a completely unsorted array of 10,000 elements takes just over
        thirty seconds on a 1 Mhz machine.
