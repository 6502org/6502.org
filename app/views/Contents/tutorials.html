    				<ul>The 6502 has several options available for comparing numbers.  Each option,

    				unfortunately, some misconceptions abound about signed (two's complement)
    				numbers and the correct way to compare them.  All of these topics are covered

                    and 65C02.  This tutorial also demonstrates how to properly distinguish whether an
