        <a href="http://dunkels.com/adam/uip/">Adam's uIP</A> - Adam Dunkels has
    		written a free, small TCP/IP stack in C which has been ported to x86,
    		8051, and 6502 systems.

  		<li>
        <a href="/users/andre/osa/index.html">Andre's GeckOS/A65</A> -
    		Andre Fachat has written a small 6502 multitasking operating system that
    		runs on the Commodore 64 and PET computers as well as his homebuilt 6502
    		projects.

        <a href="https://github.com/AcheronVM/acheronvm">David's Acheron VM</a> -
        David Holz has written a reconfigurable 16-bit virtual CPU for
        6502 systems.

        <a href="http://github.com/davidgiven">David's CP/M-65</a> - David Given 
        started his CP/M-derived operating system in 2022 and has released it under a 
        two-clause BSD license.  Unlike CP/M itself, David's system supports relocatable 
        binaries to enable machines with incompatible memory maps to run the same 
        programs.  Ports of the system are available for several computers.  The system is
        developed using tools on a modern computer, with the core components (BIOS, BDOS, 
        and CCP) being written in assembly and the utility programs being written in C.

        <a href="https://github.com/Dietrich-L/CPM-65">Dietrich's CPM-65</a> -
        Dietrich Lausberg worked on his CP/M-derived operating system throughout 
        the 1990's and was still improving it in 2022, when he released it as 
        open source under a GPL 3.0 license.  It runs on his expanded Elektor Junior
        computer but can be adapted for other machines.  The system is written entirely 
        in assembly language and can assemble itself.  It is a very complete system 
        with full source code available for the OS, its assembler, languages (BASIC and 
        FORTH), and many utility programs.

        This incredible browser-based simulator in JavaScript was made by
        photographing a 6502 chip die, converting those images to vector
        polygons, then building maps of transistor connections from those. It
        is an accurate representation of the 6502 in its most intricate details.
